Hamas and Lashkar-e-Taiba, two terrorist groups, are completely irrelevant in Maharashtra. But the BJP is to blame for sowing the worms in their (the Shinde faction\\'s) thoughts, said Raut.\\n\\nWhen Shinde made a statement at the Tuesday Dussehra rally in Mumbai\\'s Azad Maidan, Raut reacted to it. As part of the opposition alliance INDIA, Uddhav Thackeray\\'s Shiv Sena (UBT) has formed an alliance with Congress and the Samajwadi Party. Shinde remarked of this alliance: \"For their own selfishness, they will tie the knot with Hamas and Lashkar-e-Taiba.\"\\n\\nRaut highlighted that Shinde\\'s address differed from the customary Dussehra rallies conducted by the Shiv Sena each year. Raut expressed that he could make various remarks, but we adhere to the principles and values of Balasaheb Thackeray. Balasaheb Thackeray used to focus on the nation and its citizens. However, Shinde\\'s entire speech was centered on bolstering the BJP, reinforcing the position of Modi ji, and fortifying JP Nadda ji.\\n\\nIn response to the provided statement, Raut expressed his view that the occasion was Dussehra, a day traditionally associated with auspiciousness. However, he criticized Shinde for focusing on contentious matters and likened him to \"Hamas\" and \"Al Qaeda of Maharashtra.\"\\n\\nRaut also mentioned that Shinde had, in his Dussehra speech, questioned the alliance between Shiv Sena (UBT) and Akhilesh Yadav\\'s Samajwadi Party, citing an incident from 1990 when Samajwadi Party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav had reportedly ordered the use of force against karsevaks in Ayodhya.\\n\\nThis event marked the first time that Thackeray and Shinde, leaders of the divergent factions of the Shiv Sena, organized separate Dussehra rallies in Mumbai, marking a departure from the party\\'s historical practices.',\n",

We are seeing the worst tragedy. Terrorists attacked Israel, Hamas is a terror group. Israel stopped providing food, water and electricity to Gaza. We are condemning the bombing of Israel,\" Tharoor said at the event held at Kozhikode beach.\\n\\nTharoor, who had previoulsy served as an UN diplomat said the ongoing air strikes in Gaza by Israel in response to the Hamas attack was \"disproportionate.\" Reiterating Bapu\\'s words, Tharoor said, \"An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind. India has always stood for peace since Gandhi.\"\\n\\nHe also highlighted that the ongoing crisis is not a Muslim issue but a human rights issue and said \"war knows no religion.\"\\n\\n\"Israel calls their operation, \\'Swords of Iron\\', but now those swords are dipped in the blood of children. The bombing has caused a lot of injuries and innocent people are suffering and they are dying. Many are living under suffocating occupation,\" Tharoor said.\\n\\nHe said that over 6,000 Palestinians and 300 Isrealis were killed in clashes in the area between 2008 and September this year and the number of those who died since October 7, however, was much more.\\n\\n\"While 1,400 Israelis died in the Hamas terrorist attack, many more were killed in Gaza when Israel responded to it.....Innocent civilians are dying,\" Tharoor said.\\n\\n\\n\\nTharoor urged Israel to end the war and further appealed to the world to unite to \"end the human rights violations inflicted on the Palestinian people\". \"Now, it is more than time to announce a ceasefire,\" the Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram said.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile addressing the rally, IUML national general secretary PK Kunhalikutty said that the biggest weapon in the world is public opinion and that showing solidarity will bring results.\\n\\n\"Children are dying. We all are here to shed tears for the brutality in Gaza. We have no weapons to send there or save them. This rally will yield fruit because the biggest weapon in the world is public opinion. Global leaders are joining in solidarity. That\\'s how we also joined this. Solidarity has made results here. Killings should stop in Palestine,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nIUML Party workers gathered in strength for Thursday\\'s rally, which was presided over by Kunhalikutty with Shashi Tharoor as Chief Guest. IUML state president Panakkad Sayyid Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal inaugurated the rally.\\n\\nIn his speech, Thangal said \"Israel\\'s occupation has created Palestine conflict. They are trying to survive. They are trying the defend their land. Stop genocide killings. This conflict has started since 1947. Gandhi criticised Israeli occupation. Nehru, Manmohan Singh, even Vajpayee also took a stand against the Israeli occupation of Palestine... They all stood with justice. The current government is trying to dilute that stand and make Israel look holy.\"\\n\\n\"They are trying to whitewash Israel. We should stand with marginalised. India\\'s policy is to support the vulnerable people. Israel is the biggest terrorist country. Whoever is supporting Israel they are supporting terror. Justice will rise over there that\\'s why we are having this rally. With our prayers let their wounds be healed,\" the IUML leader said.\\n\\nOn attending the IUML\\'s solidarity rally, Tharoor said, \"India is one of the handful of countries that maintains ambassadors in both Israel and Palestine and enjoys good relations with both. We should be a voice for peace amid the carnage.\"\\n\\nAfter the October 7 attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip by Hamas, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set up a war cabinet and the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant said they will launch a ground offensive on Gaza, seeking to \"wipe off from the face of earth\" the Palestine-terror group.

Balasaheb had given \\'Garv se kaho hum Hindu hai\\' slogan from \\'Shivtirth\\' (Shivaji Park ground) but slogans like \\'Garv se kaho hum Congressi and Samajwadi hai\\' are being given from that venue,\" Shinde said.\\n\\nThe Shiv Sena faction led by Uddhav Thackeray organised a conventional annual Dussehra rally on Shivaji Park ground in Dadar, which the party terms \\'Shivtirth\\'.\\n\\nHe said the parties who used to target the BJP by questioning the timeline for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya are feeling embarrassed now.\\n\\n\"They have lost their face. How will they go to Ayodhya now?\" he asked.\\n\\nShinde claimed Uddhav Thackeray nurtured the ambition to become the CM since 2004 but things didn\\'t work out.\\n\\n\"It was his (Uddhav\\'s) wish to become the CM since 2004 but the \\'jugaad\\' didn\\'t work out. He pretended that he was never interested in the post. It was said publicly that he accepted the responsibility (after the 2019 assembly elections) on the advice of Sharad Pawar. But the fact is that two persons were sent to Pawar to recommend his (Uddhav\\'s) name for the post,\" he said.\\n\\nTargeting the INDIA bloc of opposition parties, Shinde said the people will bury \"the ten-headed INDIA alliance Ravan in 2024 polls\".\\n\\nHe said PM Modi will come to power for the third consecutive term next year and \"We will send 45 MPs (out of 48) from Maharashtra to strengthen his hand\".\\n\\nShinde said it was Modi who had fulfilled the dreams of Bal Thackeray by removing Article 370 and facilitating the construction of Ram temple.\\n\\n\"Once Balasaheb had said that if he became PM for a day, he would build Ram Mandir and repeal Article 370. Now under Modi’s guidance, Ram Mandir is being constructed in Ayodhya and Article 370 is scrapped,\" he added.\\n\\nShinde said those who used to taunt regarding the timeline for the construction of the Ram temple have lost their face as Modi has given the schedule of its construction. \"We all will go to Ayodhya for the inauguration of the temple\".\\n\\nHe said the massive crowd at Azad Maidan shows a “saffron wave” is prevailing in Maharashtra.\\n\\n\"This is the azad Shiv Sena\\'s azad rally at Azad Maidan, which is associated with the freedom struggle,\" he said.\\n\\nAgainst the backdrop of the acrimony between two factions of Shiv Sena over the venue of the annual Dussehra rally, Shinde said he considers any place as \\'Shivtirth\\' where Bal Thackeray\\'s thoughts can be shared openly.\\n\\nIn a jibe at Uddhav, he said, \"Those who claim to have blood relations with Balasaheb have suppressed his thoughts\".\\n\\nTerming Uddhav Thackray and his son Aaditya as \"one full, one half\", Shinde said he won\\'t be surprised if they merge their faction with Congress.\\n\\nSpeaking on the Maratha quota issue, Shinde said since he is from an ordinary Maratha family, he understands their pain and sorrow.\\n\\n\"I am aware of their pain and sorrow. The Justice Shinde (retd) committee is working 24 hours and a curative petition has been filed in the Supreme Court (which had struck down the Maratha quota) and it has been admitted. Hence a window has been opened,\" the chief minister said.\\n\\nMidway in his speech, Shinde bowed before the bust of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on the dais and vowed to grant the reservation to the Maratha community.\\n\\n“Without doing injustice to anyone and without withdrawing (reservation of anyone), this government will provide a quota to the Maratha community that will last permanently,” Shinde said.\\n\\nAppealing to youths to not take extreme steps like committing suicide for quota, Shinde said they should think of their families and children before taking any extreme step.\\n\\nHe said Bal Thackeray had castigated Mani Shankar Aiyar and Congress for \"insulting\" VD Savarkar, but they (Uddhav) are now serving the same Congress.

Resistance has been their oxygen for long. A well-known Palestinian poet has described his people as dead bodies that breathe,” he said.\\n\\nThe IUML leader pointed out that India had been supporting them after realising Israel’s hidden agenda of invasion. “People like Mahatma Gandhi, father of our nation, have criticised the invasion. Prime Ministers from Nehru to Manmohan Singh continued that line. Even Atal Bihari Vajpayee was supporting Palestine. The current dispensation at the Centre, however, has diluted our position and is seen whitewashing Israel. It is condemnable,” he said.\\n\\nTerming Israel “the biggest terrorist nation in the world”, the Thangal said countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom were found to be supporting it. These Western nations, which always talk about human rights, were turning a blind eye towards what was happening in Gaza. “A free Palestine is the only solution, for which political talks should be held. Israel should stop its terrorist activities and fall in line,” he added.\\n\\nThousands of people, including a large number of women, from across northern Kerala districts gathered on the beach to attend the event, which also proved to be a show of strength of the IUML ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.

The number of those who died since October 7, however, was much more.\\n\\n“While 1,400 Israelis died in the Hamas terrorist attack, many more were killed in Gaza when Israel responded to it.

Before this war ends, that sword will have to be dipped in the blood of how many children we don’t know,” Mr. Tharoor said.\\n\\nThe Congress leader also accused Israel of violating international agreements on war such as the Geneva Convention while pounding Gaza. He said hapless children and women were getting killed and religious places of worship, including an Orthodox church over 1,000 years old, were destroyed. The UN relief agency had said it was left with no or little fuel. “Hospitals are facing difficulties while attending to the wounded. There is no clean water, power, petrol or diesel. Israel is allowing very few trucks from Egypt carrying essentials to enter Gaza,” Mr. Tharoor said.\\n\\nHe ended his speech calling for a ceasefire by Israel and quoted the late Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, “The war will end, the leaders will shake hands, the old woman will keep waiting for her martyred son, That girl will wait for her beloved husband.

       " {'articleBody': 'At a rally organised by Congress ally Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) in Kozhikode on Thursday in solidarity with Palestine, Congress Working Committee member and party MP Shashi Tharoor referred to Hamas as terrorists.\\n\\nTharoor was the chief guest at the Palestine solidarity rally in Kozhikode. The IUML handpicked Tharoor as the keynote speaker at the event, bypassing prominent faces of the party’s state leadership, considering the erudition of the diplomat-turned politician on international affairs.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt may be recalled that the CWC in a resolution on October 9 had reaffirmed its support to the Palestinian cause without mentioning the October 7 attack carried out by Hamas on Israel.\\n\\n“The CWC expresses its dismay and anguish on the war that has broken out in the Middle East where over a thousand people have been killed in the last two days. The CWC reiterates its long-standing support for the rights of the Palestinian people to land, self-government and to live with dignity and respect. The CWC calls for an immediate cease-fire and for negotiations to begin on all outstanding issues including the imperative issues that have given rise to the present conflict,” the CWC resolution had said.\\n\\nHowever, the party did a course correction later when its spokesperson Pavan Khera condemned the Hamas attack on Israel. “The Congress unequivocally condemns the attack on the innocent civilians of Israel by Hamas,” Khera had said on October 13.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nReferring to the present bout of war between Hamas and Israel, Tharoor said, “On October 7, terrorists attacked Israel, killed 1,400 people and took 200 hostages. In answer to that, Israel has so far killed 6,000 people. They have stopped the supply of food, water and fuel to Gaza. Hospitals are bombed. Innocent people are being killed every day. What is happening is the violation of war laws and Geneva Convention, which have provisions for protecting the innocent civilians.’’\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHe continued. “one thing I want to say. When those terrorists massacred unarmed people, the world had condemned it. Now, everyone is condemning the Israel bombing. Terrorist acts took place from both sides. Eye for eye would make the whole world blind. What we are seeing now is a heinous reaction. We are seeing a disproportionate reaction,’’ he said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTharoor said the death toll in the latest bout of crisis in the last 19 days is more than the casualty that took place in the last 15 years. “Around 1,400 Israelis and 6,000 Palestinians have been killed so far. The West Bank region had not witnessed any terrorism. However, 102 Palestine people and one Israeli were killed,” he said.\\n\\nTharoor said the issue should not be considered as a Muslim issue on the ground that the rally is being conducted by IUML, a secular and democratic party. “None should think that this is a Muslim issue. It is a matter of human rights. War knows no religion. Christians in Gaza were also killed in the bombing,’’ he said.\\n\\nAt the same venue, senior IUML leader and party legislator Dr M K Muneer, apparently took a dig at Tharoor.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMuneer, in his address, said, “When Bhagat Singh and Subhas Chandra Bose fought for the freedom of the country, it was recorded in British history as an act of terrorism and extremism. At Gaza, the fight of Palestine for freedom would be an act of terrorism in the eye of imperialistic forces. But the children at Gaza now say that they were now offering namaz not five times a day, but six times. The children say every day they have ‘janaza’ (funeral prayer). The fight of Palestine is freedom struggle and that of Israel is genocide. We are with that defence of Palestine. We should be able to differentiate between defence and attack,’’ he said.\\n\\nSince the latest crisis in the Middle East, both Congress and CPI(M) in Kerala have been treading cautiously on the issue, considering visible ‘pro-Palestine’ sentiments in the state. CPI(M) central committee member K K Shailaja had come under fire from within the party itself after she dubbed Hamas as terrorists. Later, she had to drop the “terror’’ tag from Hamas, in a clarification on her views on the crisis.',\n",

In his speech, he criticised Uddhav Thackeray. Addressing a huge rally at Shiv Sena’s Dussehra rally at Azad Maidan, without naming Thackeray, Shinde said he had stabbed Bal Thackeray in the back by dishonesty with his ideological heritage. Eknath Shinde said that Uddhav Thackeray left the Hindutva ideology long ago and can now even embrace Islamic terrorist outfits like Hamas.\\n\\n‘Shiv Teerth is at a place where Balasaheb Thackeray’s ideology is continued’\\n\\nWishing one and all on the occasion of Dussehra, Eknath Shinde said, “This is an Azad meeting of an Azad Shiv Sena on the Azad Maidan. It is this Azad Maidan where people would stage protests in the pre-independence era against British rule. Balasaheb Thackeray used to address the Dussehra meeting on Shiv Teerth (Shivaji Park ground). People are holding their rallies at that place today. We are at Azad Maidan. But we believe that Shiv Teerth is at a place where Balasaheb Thackeray’s ideology is continued.”\\n\\nCM Eknath Shinde said, “I am the Chief Minister of this state. I could have easily held the meeting at Shivaji Park Ground last year as well as this year. But I do not want the state to witness unnecessary fights and troubles. Last year we held this meeting at Bandra Kurla Complex Ground. This year we are at Azad Maidan.”\\n\\nUddhav Thackeray can embrace terrorist outfits like Hamas\\n\\nEknath Shinde said, “It would not be surprising if they (Shiv Sena-UBT) ally with the Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM). They would even embrace terrorist organisations like Hamas, Hizbul Mujahideen, and Lashkar-e-Taiba for their selfish purposes and power.”\\n\\nEknath Shinde added, “He buried Bal Thackeray’s Hindutva ideology for power and joined hands with the Congress and the Samajwadi Party. Balasaheb had raised the slogan ‘Proudly say we are Hindus’ from Shiv Teerth, but slogans like ‘Proudly say we are Congressmen and socialists’ are being given from that place.”\\n\\nEknath Shinde also targeted Uddhav Thackeray for questioning the dates of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. He said, “The parties that used to target the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by questioning the timeline for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya are now feeling embarrassed. They are now exposed. How will they go to Ayodhya now?”\\n\\nUddhav Thackeray wanted to become the chief minister of the state in 2004\\n\\nShinde claimed that Uddhav Thackeray had ambitions of becoming chief minister since 2004, but it could not happen. He said, “He wished to become the chief minister since 2004 but the ‘jugaad’ did not work. He showed that he had never been interested in this post. It was publicly stated that he accepted the responsibility for Sharad Pawar’s advice after the 2019 assembly elections. But the fact is that two persons were sent to Pawar to recommend his name for this post. He is wearing many masks. He takes advantage of the opportunity.”\\n\\nNarendra Modi fulfilled the dreams of Balasaheb Thackeray\\n\\nEknath Shinde said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi will come to power for the third consecutive time next year. We will send 45 MPs from Maharashtra to strengthen him. It was Modi who fulfilled Bal Thackeray’s dreams through the removal of Article 370 and the construction of Ram Mandir. People will bury the 10-headed I.N.D.I. alliance Ravana in the 2024 elections.”\\n\\nCommitted to Maratha Reservation\\n\\nEknath Shinde said, “The state government is committed to giving reservation to the Maratha community in a manner that the reservation will stand in the legal test. I appeal to Maratha youths not to suicide.',\n",

Mumbai: In a fiery address during a grand Dussehra rally at the historic Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Maidan in Dadar, Central Mumbai, Shiv Sena Party President Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray lashed out at Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde for defecting from the party and forming a coalition with the BJP to govern Maharashtra.\\n\\nThackeray expressed his disapproval of the Shinde Sena, referring to them as a group of opportunists driven solely by the pursuit of power.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nHowever, Chief Minister Shinde, speaking at a rival rally at Azad Maidan in South Mumbai, countered by accusing those who left Shiv Sena to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Government with the Congress of betraying the legacy of Shiv Sena patriarch late Balasaheb Thackeray. He even recalled a 2004 incident when Balasaheb protested derogatory remarks against Veer Savarkar.\\n\\nDiverging from Hindutva\\n\\nShinde criticized Shiv Sena (UBT) for straying from the path of Hindutva and forming alliances with Congress and socialist groups. He went so far as to suggest the party might merge with Congress or align with AIMIM, Owaisi, Hamas, Hizbul, and Lashkar-e-Taiba, implying that the party was motivated by self-interest rather than ideology.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nShinde also mentioned alleged corruption in the Brihanmumbai Mumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), questionable procurement of medicines during the Covid pandemic, and the state of Mumbai’s roads.\\n\\nIn response, Thackeray challenged Shinde to conduct comprehensive investigations into BMC, Thane, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, and Nagpur municipal corporations, as well as the “PM Cares Fund” set up during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nTaking a swipe at Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nThackeray took a veiled dig at Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, referencing a recent flood in Nagpur that caused significant damage. He suggested that Fadnavis had failed to prevent the disaster.\\n\\nIndo-Pak match analogy\\n\\nThackeray also criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi for hosting a cricket match with Pakistan after the formation of the Opposition Alliance (INDIA).\\n\\nHe equated this decision to Balasaheb Thackeray’s stance against allowing Pakistan to play cricket in India until Pakistan ceased terrorist activities. Thackeray argued that if they call his party traitors, the same label should apply to the government.\\n\\nCall for alliance government\\n\\nThackeray concluded by stating that the country needs a new government, emphasizing the importance of alliances over absolute majorities.\\n\\nMaratha reservation\\n\\nRegarding the ongoing Maratha community reservation protest, Thackeray suggested that the issue could be resolved in the Lok Sabha. He called for unanimous solutions to the reservations of Dhangar, OBC, and Marathas in Parliament.\\n\\nChief Minister Shinde reassured the Maratha community that the state government was committed to providing reservations without affecting other communities’ quotas, urging the youth not to resort to extreme measures like suicide.\\n\\nAlso Read: Chief Minister Eknath Shinde Declares Renaming of Maharashtra’s Ahmednagar to Ahilya Nagar',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Kozhikode: Congress leader and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor termed the Hamas attack against Israel as a \"terrorist act” at the rally held by the Indian Union Muslim League in solidarity with Palestine. He used the term multiple times throughout the speech.\\n\\nTharoor condemned the “disproportionate retaliation” of Israel and stated that the country was committing war crimes. He reminded that India has always stood with Palestine and even Mahatma Gandhi was against the formation of Israel in Arab land.\\n\\nHowever, Dr MK Muneer, MLA, who spoke last at the event, without naming Tharoor, said that resistance and attack are different and the Muslim League always supports Palestine.\\n\\nExcerpts from the speech by Tharoor:\\n\\n“For the past 19 days, the world has been witnessing one of the worst human rights tragedies. Thousands of people died, including innocent women and children. First in Israel, then in Gaza. There are historical reasons and people may have their own arguments, but no one can justify actions that trouble people.”\\n\\n“India has always stood for peace, since the time of Gandhiji. We have always stood for a permanent solution to this crisis. For Israelis and Palestinians living side-by-side with dignity and security in their own lands and behind their own borders. But that is not what we are seeing.\\n\\n“On October 7, terrorists attacked Israel and killed 1,400 individuals and took 200 people hostage. But in retaliation, Israel killed 6,000 people.”\\n\\nThe MP added that Israel was violating war laws.\\n\\n“There are some laws even for war, like the one to protect innocent civilians. But Israel violates everything. Humanitarian aid is not sufficient as they don\\'t let it enter Gaza.”\\n\\n“When terrorists attacked innocent women and children, the world condemned them. But we also condemned when Israel bombed.”\\n\\n“Gandhi once said, an eye for an eye will make the whole world blind. As I said earlier, terrorist activities have taken place on both sides. The death toll is higher than in the last 15 years of war. During that period, more than 6,000 Palestinians died. Around 300 Israelis also died.”\\n\\n“Palestinians live under suffocating occupation. Even during these days, in the West Bank where there were no terrorist activities, 102 Palestinians were killed while only one Israeli died.”\\n\\n“IUML is a secular party. This rally is not to highlight a Muslim issue. This is a human rights issue. War knows no religion. Christians were also killed in Gaza.”\\n\\nTharoor also narrated the history of the Israel-Palestine conflict. He recalled that India stood with Palestine and opposed the creation of Israel.\\n\\nMuneer\\'s reply\\n\\nWhile speaking at the event, MLA MK Muneer said: \"Britishers consider the fights of Bhagat Singh and Subhash Chandra Bose as a terrorist act. Similarly, the imperialists consider the fight in Gaza as a terrorist act. The children of Palestine say they pray six times a day, including Janazah (funeral prayer in Islam). Palestine is fighting for freedom while Israel is committing a genocide. As Bertolt Brecht said, ‘...the most beautiful of all doubts is when the downtrodden and despondent raise their heads and stop believing in the strength of their oppressors.’”',\n",

I take the oath before Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj that quotas for the Marathas will be given without disturbing the reservations for any other groups… All are our people and no injustice will be done to any community. I urge the Maratha youth not to resort to any desperate (suicide) measures,\" he said.\\n\\nAttacking the Shiv Sena-UBT, Shinde said that he belonged to a poor farmer family and struggled all his life to reach this position today, endured caning and even went to jail.\\n\\n“How many cases you have against you, how many times you have taken caning? Those who claim to be heirs to Balasaheb Thackeray’s legacy must first examine their conduct… They are not a ‘dena’ (give) bank, but a ‘lena’ (take) bank. I have not hankered for power and I continue to function as an ordinary worker, I go to Davos (Switzerland) for business or inspect drains and public toilets in slums…” said Shinde.\\n\\nOn the contrary, the CM alleged that Uddhav Thackeray coveted the post of CM since 2004 and for this he had sent two emissaries to meet Sharad Pawar to become the CM, and betrayed the Hindutva cause of Balasaheb Thackeray.\\n\\n\"For us, Balasaheb Thackeray’s ideals are our principles but how many times you have compromised them for money and power. Tomorrow, it won’t be surprising if his party (Shiv Sena-UBT) merges with the Congress, or joins hands with the AIMIM, or with the Hamas, Hizbul and Lashkar-e-Taiba… They don’t care about the common Shiv Sainiks, they are concerned only with their family,\" he claimed.\\n\\nThe CM targeted Thackeray for pushing behind the state in terms of investments, and claimed that in just one year, “along with (Deputy CMs) Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar” Maharashtra has catapulted to the top slot in FDI, development is happening briskly on all fronts, and wherever he travels, \"the people are happy with the progress\".\\n\\nShinde called upon the people to support Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2024 elections by giving at least 45 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra to the BJP. “Modi is fulfilling the dreams of Balasaheb Thackeray like repealing Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir or constructing the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya… I have done the work of saving the Shiv Sena which was mortgaged with the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (SP),\" declared Shinde.\\n\\nResponding to Thackeray’s criticism on delinking Mumbai from Maharashtra, Shinde asserted that “till I am alive, nobody’s father will dare to do this”.\\n\\nRecounting the alleged scams of the erstwhile Maha Vikas Aghadi government especially during the c coronavirus pandemic, Shinde said that “you were at home busy counting money… you ate up the ‘khichdi’ money and the oxygen funds”, and warned that the people of Maharashtra will teach them a lesson for their sins.\\n\\n\"Uddhav Thackeray had no great achievements, that is why Anand Dighe (former Thane strongman) had praised Raj Thackeray in a meeting… And for this Dighe was humiliated, and I have witnessed it myself. After that appreciation of Raj Thackeray, the work of clipping Dighe’ wings started,\" he claimed.\\n\\nOn the decision to hold the rally at Azad Maidan, Shinde said that as the CM, he would have easily conducted the meeting at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Park, also known as ‘Shiv Tirth’. “However, we opted for Azad Maidan to avoid any law and order problems and for us wherever we carry forward the vision of Balasaheb Thackeray becomes our ‘Shiv Tirth’.

This is a rally for peace,\" the Thiruvananthapuram MP said.\\n\\nHe said that innocent women and children had suffered casualties, initially in Israel and subsequently in Gaza, and emphasised the imperative of ending this conflict.\\n\\nTharoor underscored India\\'s historical commitment to peace, tracing it back to the era of Mahatma Gandhi.\\n\\n\"We have always stood for a permanent solution to this crisis,\" he said.\\n\\nIn unequivocal terms, Tharoor also condemned the attack carried out by Palestinian armed group Hamas in Israel on October 7, describing it as an \\'act of terror\\'.\\n\\n\"On October 7, terrorists attacked Israel and claimed 1,400 lives. Two hundred individuals were taken hostage. In response, Israel killed 6,000 people. The bombing continues,\" he had said.\\n\\nLet the Truth be known.

       " {'articleBody': 'New Delhi: Calling for immediate de-escalation in strained diplomatic relations between India and Canada, Ujjal Dosanjh, former premier of British Columbia and erstwhile Canadian Minister of Health, stressed that India\\'s \"muscular\" foreign policy is essentially for domestic consumption and not granting visas to Canadian citizens hurts ordinary Indo-Canadians.\\n\\n“You cannot give collective punishment just because a few have erred. It is people like us who suffer,” he tells IANS.\\n\\nThe diplomatic row that erupted after Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar was shot in Canada, and the Canadian Prime Minister alleged the possible involvement of Indian security agencies has now led to the expulsion of 41 Canadian diplomats and a visa ban from India.\\n\\nMaintaining that it is only a minuscule Punjabi population in Canada that raises the demand for Khalistan, and the majority continues to be pro-India, Dosanjh, who publicly took on the Khalistanis in the 80s and survived a major attack with almost 100 stitches, feels that the whole situation could have been handled more maturely. “Let us not forget that (Justin) Trudeau is surrounded by Khalistanis. However, he should have made the statement in Parliament with some kind of proof. Of course, the fact that the media was all set to publish the story, and he had to act fast is also understandable,” he says.\\n\\nWhile stressing that in a free country like Canada, there is nothing wrong in demanding Khalistan, the former Health Minister asserts that keeping in mind the friendly relations between the two countries, the Canadian Prime Minister should make it clear that he does not support the dismemberment of India. “It did not take long for the Canadian PM to condemn the glorification of the violence Hamas unleashed on Israel recently, what is stopping from condemning the violence of Khalistanis in Canada? By the way, I also wonder if some people in Canada are so interested in the idea of Khalistan, why don’t they come here”\\n\\nDosanjh, who was recently at the Khushwant Singh Literary Festival in Kasauli, added that contrary to popular perception in India, the idea of Khalistan has very little role to play in Canadian elections, adds, “It is the state of the economy that drives people’s voting behaviour.”\\n\\nBelieving that a little more maturity shown by leaders of both countries can be instrumental in putting the Indo-Canadian relations back on track, he says even the Indian side needs to be less touchy and jingoistic. “Trudeau had other platforms to raise the issue and not make a statement like that in the Parliament. The Indian side can formally request countries for extradition, and stop using international issues for domestic gains.”\\n\\nLooking back at his political career in Canada, he says his heart has always been that of an activist and not a politician. “When I ran, and I won. I never thought I would do all the things that I did,” he concludes.',\n",

Photograph: ANI Photo\\n\\nAddressing a massive gathering at the Dussehra rally of Shiv Sena in Azad Maidan, Shinde, without naming Thackeray, said he back-stabbed Bal Thackeray by committing dishonesty with his ideological legacy.\\n\\nShinde also said he won\\'t be surprised if they (Shiv Sena-UBT) ally with Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen and even \\'hug terrorist organisations such as Hamas, Hizbul Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Taiba for their selfish motives and chair (power)\\'.\\n\\nHe also reiterated that the state government is committed to granting quota to Maraths which will stand the legal scrutiny and appealed to youths not to take extreme steps like committing suicide.\\n\\n\"You have buried the Hindutva ideology of Balasaheb Thackeray by going with Congress and Samajwadis for power.

But the fact is that two persons were sent to Pawar to recommend his (Uddhav\\'s) name for the post,\" he said.\\n\\nTargeting the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) of opposition parties, Shinde said the people will bury \\'the ten-headed INDIA alliance Ravan in 2024 polls\\'.\\n\\nHe said PM Modi will come to power for the third consecutive term next year and \\'We will send 45 MPs (out of 48) from Maharashtra to strengthen his hand\\'.\\n\\nShinde said it was Modi who had fulfilled the dreams of Bal Thackeray by removing Article 370 and facilitating the construction of Ram temple.\\n\\n\"Once Balasaheb had said that if he became PM for a day, he would build Ram Mandir and repeal Article 370. Now under Modi\\'s guidance, Ram Mandir is being constructed in Ayodhya and Article 370 is scrapped,\" he added.\\n\\nShinde said those who used to taunt regarding the timeline for the construction of the Ram temple have lost their face as Modi has given the schedule of its construction. \"We all will go to Ayodhya for the inauguration of the temple\".\\n\\nHe said the massive crowd at Azad Maidan shows a saffron wave is prevailing in Maharashtra.\\n\\n\"This is the azad Shiv Sena\\'s azad rally at Azad Maidan, which is associated with the freedom struggle,\" he said.\\n\\nAgainst the backdrop of the acrimony between two factions of Shiv Sena over the venue of the annual Dussehra rally, Shinde said he considers any place as \\'Shivtirth\\' where Bal Thackeray\\'s thoughts can be shared openly.\\n\\nIn a jibe at Uddhav, he said, \"Those who claim to have blood relations with Balasaheb have suppressed his thoughts.\"\\n\\nTerming Uddhav Thackray and his son Aaditya as \\'one full, one half\\', Shinde said he won\\'t be surprised if they merge their faction with Congress.\\n\\nSpeaking on the Maratha quota issue, Shinde said since he is from an ordinary Maratha family, he understands their pain and sorrow.\\n\\n\"I am aware of their pain and sorrow. The Justice Shinde (retd) committee is working 24 hours and a curative petition has been filed in the Supreme Court (which had struck down the Maratha quota) and it has been admitted. Hence a window has been opened,\" the chief minister said.\\n\\nMidway in his speech, Shinde bowed before the bust of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on the dais and vowed to grant the reservation to the Maratha community.\\n\\nWithout doing injustice to anyone and without withdrawing (reservation of anyone), this government will provide a quota to the Maratha community that will last permanently, Shinde said.\\n\\nAppealing to youths to not take extreme steps like committing suicide for quota, Shinde said they should think of their families and children before taking any extreme step.\\n\\nHe said Bal Thackeray had castigated Mani Shankar Aiyar and Congress for \\'insulting\\' VD Savarkar, but they (Uddhav) are now serving the same Congress.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'The crude bomb attack on the Raj Bhawan has unnerved the authorities. Notably, Raj Bhavan itself has expressed dissatisfaction with the police’s handling of the case. In a statement posted on social media, Raj Bhavan claimed that the police had not registered their complaint regarding the attack. Instead, the police, on their own initiative, treated the incident as a simple act of vandalism. To further complicate matters, the police hastily arrested the accused, leading to his remand in jail at midnight. This abrupt move also involved waking up a magistrate late in the night and preventing a more detailed interrogation that might have shed light on those responsible for the attack.\\n\\nRaj Bhavan’s statement conveyed a deep concern that a fair investigation had been thwarted before it could even begin. The implications of this incident and the subsequent handling by the authorities have prompted the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to step in, aiming to uncover the startling aspects of the case that have come to light.\\n\\nIn a concerning incident at Guindy Raj Bhavan, a habitual offender and history sheeter who was released on bail just three days prior breached the high-security zone and threw country bombs on the premises. The incident took place on the afternoon of October 25.\\n\\nThe police initially reported that the bombs landed near the barricade at the front gate, causing no damage, and that the assailant was swiftly arrested. However, a complaint filed by Deputy Secretary to the Governor, Sengottaiyan, provided a contrasting version of events. In his complaint to the Commission of Greater Chennai, Sengottaiyan described a severe attack against the Constitutional Head of the State of Tamil Nadu.\\n\\nAccording to the complaint, a miscreant armed with petrol bombs attempted to breach Main Gate No. 1 of Raj Bhavan around 2:45 pm on the same day. It was due to the alertness of the security personnel at the Raj Bhavan that they managed to thwart the assailants’ entry. The first petrol bomb hurled at the main entrance gate caused a significant damage. Despite the security personnel’s efforts to subdue the attacker, another petrol bomb was thrown, resulting in severe damage to the entrance.\\n\\nSengottaiyan further noted that, over several months, there have been ongoing attacks against the honourable governor, often involving verbal abuse and threats to his life. These attacks have predominantly come from leaders and members of the DMK and its allies during public meetings and through social media. Their intent appears to be to intimidate the Governor and hinder him from carrying out his constitutional duties.\\n\\nHowever, Sengottaiyan pointed out that previous complaints lodged with the police had yielded no significant action or results. He cited a specific incident from April 18, 2022, where the Governor was physically attacked with sticks and stones while en route to a scheduled function at the Dharmapuram Adheenam. Despite complaints filed by Raj Bhavan, no FIR was registered, and no action was taken against the culprits. This sequence of events underscores concerns about the governor’s safety and the need for a thorough investigation into the recent attack on Guindy Raj Bhavan.\\n\\nAmidst various incidents of threats and abuse directed at the Governor, an officer from Raj Bhavan has voiced serious concerns about the police’s response to these incidents. The officer revealed that previous cases involving public threats to the governor were not treated with the necessary seriousness by the police. In these instances, the police did not faithfully register First Information Reports (FIRs) and often downplayed the significance of the events, categorising them as minor offences with no meaningful follow-up.\\n\\nThe officer emphasised that the police’s studied indifference to the Governor’s safety had compromised both his security and that of Raj Bhavan. This situation has ultimately culminated in a brazen bomb attack on Raj Bhavan.\\n\\nExpressing his alarm, the officer pointed out that ongoing verbal and physical threats and attacks against the Governor, the highest Constitutional authority in the state, had severely undermined security measures. This deterioration in security is now evident in the recent bomb attack. The officer urged authorities to take serious note of the attack, highlighting that the offences committed fall under Section 124 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which is specifically intended for threats to the Governor.\\n\\nThe officer further emphasised that a governor cannot effectively discharge their duties under the constant shadow of threats. As a result, he urged the authorities to take the necessary steps to ensure a thorough investigation, appropriate punishment for those involved in the attacks, including any conspirators, and enhanced security measures for the Governor’s safety.\\n\\nPress Release No: 71 pic.twitter.com/FofY87mJZO — RAJ BHAVAN, TAMIL NADU (@rajbhavan_tn) October 25, 2023\\n\\nIn the wake of the bomb attack on Guindy Raj Bhavan, Chennai Police identified the suspect as K Vinod, a known history-sheeter and habitual offender with a record of six to seven cases against him. According to the police, Vinod was in an inebriated state when he committed the crime.\\n\\nThe police’s statement regarding Vinod’s inebriation at the time of the attack follows a common pattern, as it is often used when individuals are accused of attacking temples or engaging in vandalism.\\n\\nA case has been registered against Vinod under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including sections 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), and 506(ii) (criminal intimidation). Additionally, charges have been filed under Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act and Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Property (Prevention of Damage and Loss) Act at the Guindy police station.\\n\\nThe police also mentioned that Raj Bhavan’s complaint regarding the incident was received around 11 pm. They have assured that the details provided in the complaint will be thoroughly examined as part of the ongoing investigation into the bomb attack.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the bomb attack on Guindy Raj Bhavan, several political figures and government officials expressed their viewpoints on the incident.\\n\\nTN BJP State President K Annamalai took to Twitter to claim that the same individual responsible for the attack on the BJP headquarters in Chennai in February 2022 was behind the attack on Raj Bhavan. He expressed concerns about the recurrent attacks and insinuated that the DMK government might be involved in sponsoring these acts.\\n\\nUnion Minister L Murugan expressed his dismay over the incident, emphasising that it signifies a breakdown in law and order. He raised concerns about the safety and ability of the constitutional head of the state, the Governor, to perform his duties without threats. Murugan called for the case to be transferred to either the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or the National Investigation Agency (NIA).\\n\\nAIADMK Chief Edappadi Palaniswami characterised the attack as a significant example of the deterioration of law and order in the state.\\n\\nContrary to the criticisms, DMK’s Law Minister, S. Regupathy condemned the attack and denied any security lapse at Raj Bhavan. He affirmed that the Raj Bhavan is well protected and that an investigation is in progress.\\n\\nUnconfirmed reports suggest that the NIA has taken it upon itself to initiate an investigation into the incident. The case continues to unfold as authorities at various levels weigh in on the matter.\\n\\nAmid growing questions about who facilitated bail for habitual criminal Krukku Vinodh, recent information from a 24×7 News Tamil channel appears to provide indirect answers. Prison authorities are reported to have described Vinodh’s emergence from jail in the company of banned Popular Front of India (PFI) cadres as a mere coincidence.\\n\\nIncidentally, this development has unfolded in the context of ongoing protests and demonstrations concerning Palestine. Just two days ago, several Muslim outfits organised a protest in support of Palestine, during which one of the speakers controversially likened Israel and India to “two terrorist nations in the world.” Following this, the Federation of All Islamic Organisations and some political parties have called for a protest in Chennai on October 31.\\n\\nHowever, an alarming incident recently took place in Coimbatore’s Ukkadam area, where individuals raised a Palestine flag atop a flyover. In response, the police have taken action, arresting Sabir Ali from the Jamaat-e-Hind outfit, as well as Abu Thahir and Rabeeq from the Manitha Neya Democratic party. Cases have been registered in connection with this incident.\\n\\nAdditionally, New College students in Chennai, an institution run by the Muslim Association of Southern India (MEASI), organised a demonstration in support of Palestine. The events surrounding the bail arrangement for Vinodh and the broader protests linked to Palestine continue to raise concerns and prompt ongoing discussions.\\n\\nhttps://fb.watch/nW9pZ18IPE/\\n\\nIn the wake of the recent bomb attack on the Governor’s residence, social media influencers have voiced their concerns, characterising the incident as a glaring and extraordinary display of anti-social, rowdy, and fundamentalist elements running rampant in the state of Tamil Nadu.\\n\\nThey argue that political parties disenchanted with the governor’s perceived anti-Dravidian stance and his disapproval of appeasement policies implemented by both the DMK and AIADMK have aligned with other factions advocating divisive politics. In particular, the influencers point to calls for the premature release of 36 Muslim prisoners and the removal of the BJP party flagpole, following objections from Muslims. These actions, they argue, have emboldened elements within the state to engage in such audacious acts.\\n\\nThe influencers also referred to the tragic assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi by LTTE cadres in 1991, which remains vivid in the memories of Tamil Nadu residents. Given this historical context, they contend that providing excessive leeway to Dravidian parties, anti-national elements, naxal groups, and fundamentalists could jeopardise not only the state’s security but also India’s national security interests at large. These concerns highlight the broader implications of the recent attack on the Governor’s residence.',\n",

Slamming Western powers that have voiced support for Israel\\'s retaliation against Hamas, the Turkish president said, \"Western tears shed for Israel are a manifestation of fraud\".\\n\\nFollowing his remarks, Italy\\'s deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini said that they were \"grave and disgusting and did not help with de-escalation\".\\n\\n\"I will propose to my colleague (Foreign Minister Antonio) Tajani to send a formal protest and to summon the Turkish Ambassador,\" Matteo Salvini said.\\n\\nTurkey foreign minister Hakan Fidan said that Israel committed \"a crime against humanity\" in its war in Gaza while speaking in Qatar.\\n\\n\"Targeting our Palestinian brothers, including children, patients and the elderly, even in schools, hospitals and mosques, is a crime against humanity,\" he said.\\n\\nTel Aviv rejected Tayyip Erdogan\\'s assertion saying that, “Israel wholeheartedly rejects the Turkish president\\'s harsh words about the terrorist organization Hamas. Even the Turkish president\\'s attempt to defend the terrorist organization and his inciting words will not change the horrors that the whole world has seen.”\\n\\nEarlier, Turkey condemned the civilians deaths that resulted from Hamas\\' October 7 attack but also urged Israel to react in a restrained way. Ankara has also strongly condemned Israel\\'s heavy bombardment of Gaza while offering to mediate in the conflict and sending humanitarian aid.\\n\\nAccusing Israel of taking advantage of Turkey\\'s good intentions, Erdogan said that he had now cancelled a planned trip to Israel.\\n\\nTurkey has also backed a two-state solution to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON',\n",

       " {'articleBody': \"Supermodel Bella Hadid, who has long been a vocal supporter of Palestine, raked in some criticism for not speaking about the ongoing Palestine-Israel war. She has finally broken her silence. (Also read: About Gigi Hadid Palestine connection: How her father's family was ‘kicked out’ by Jewish family they gave shelter to) Bella Hadid is of Palestinian descent from her father's side.\\n\\nBella penned a long note on Instagram, beginning it with an apology for staying silent for so long. “Forgive me for my silence. I have yet to find the ideal words for this deeply intricate and horrific past 2 weeks, weeks that have turned the world's attention back towards a situation that has been taking innocent lives and affecting families for decades. I have much to say, but for today, I will keep it short,” she began her note.\\n\\nBella also mentioned how she, too, has been impacted by the crisis. “I've been sent hundreds of death threats daily, my phone number has been leaked, and my family has felt to be in danger. But I can not be silenced any longer. Fear is not an option. The people and children of Palestine, especially in Gaza, cannot afford our silence. We are not brave - they are,” she wrote.\\n\\n“My heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood. Seeing the aftermath from the airstrikes in Gaza, I mourn with all the mothers who have lost children and the children who cry alone, all the lost fathers, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunties, friends that will never again walk this earth,” she added.\\n\\nBella also wrote about the suffering that Israeli civilians have also had to deal with at the hands of Hamas. “I mourn for the Israeli families that have been dealing with the pain and aftermath of October 7th. Regardless of the history of the land, I condemn the terrorist attacks on any civilians, anywhere. Harming women and children and inflicting terror does not and should not do any good for the Free Palestine movement. I believe deep in my heart, that no child, no people anywhere, should be taken away from their family either temporarily or indefinitely. That goes for Israeli and Palestinian people alike,” she said.\\n\\n“It's important to understand the hardship of what it is to be Palestinian, in a world that sees us as nothing more than terrorists resisting peace. It is harmful, it is shameful, and it's categorically untrue,” she wrote.\\n\\nTalking about her family history, she wrote. “My father was born in Nazareth in the year of the Nakba (the displacement of 750,000 Palestinians in 1948). Nine days after he was born, he, in his mothers arms, along with his family were expelled from their home of Palestine, becoming refugees, away from a place they once called home. My grandparents, never being allowed to return. My family witnessed 75 years of violence against Palestinian people-most notably, brutal settler invasions which led to the destruction of entire communities, murder in cold blood and the forcible removal of families from their homes. The practice of settlements on Palestinian land still continues to this day. The pain of that is unimaginable.”\\n\\nBella blamed the government and not the people's religions for what has been unfolding. “We must all stand together in defending humanity and compassion - and demanding that our leaders do the same. All religions are peace - it is governments that are corrupt, and intertwining the two makes for the greatest sin of all. We are one, and God has created all equal. All bloodshed, tears, and bodies should be mourned with the same respect,” she wrote.\\n\\n“There is an urgent humanitarian crisis in Gaza that must be attended to. Families need access to water and food. Hospitals need fuel to power generators, tend to the wounded and keep people alive. Wars have laws - and they must be upheld, no matter what. We need to keep pressure on our leaders, wherever we are, not to forget the urgent needs of the people of Gaza, and to ensure that innocent Palestinian civilians are not the forgotten casualties of this war. I stand with humanity, knowing that peace and safety belong to us all,” she concluded.\\n\\nBella's post got her support from her fans. Her mother Yolanda Hadid wrote, “Brave, honest and from the heart, i love you.” A person commented, “There is the real Wonder Woman! We love you! ur family is beautiful inside and out. Thank you for always being proudly and unapologetically Palestine.”\\n\\nThe conflict between Israel and Palestinian forces since the militant group Hamas' Oct. 7 assault have created a huge and rising death toll - and accusations of war crimes - on both sides.\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON\\n\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR HT Entertainment Desk Dedicated professionals who write about cinema and television in all their vibrancy.

Nasrallah oversees the seven-member Shura Council and its five subcouncils: the political assembly, the jihad assembly, the parliamentary assembly, the executive assembly, and the judicial assembly. The U.S. State Department estimates that Hezbollah has tens of thousands of members and other supporters worldwide.\\n\\nHezbollah controls much of Lebanon’s Shiite-majority areas, including parts of Beirut, southern Lebanon, and the eastern Bekaa Valley region. Although Hezbollah is based in Lebanon, its manifesto clarifies that its operations, especially those targeting the United States, are not confined by domestic borders: “The American threat is not local or restricted to a particular region, and as such, confrontation of such a threat must be international as well.” The group has been accused of planning and perpetrating acts of terrorism against Israeli and Jewish targets abroad, and there is evidence of Hezbollah operations in Africa, the Americas, and Asia.\\n\\n• Iran and Hezbollah-Connect the dots\\n\\n• Map Work-Lebanon\\n\\n• The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Hezbollah-Connect the dots\\n\\n• Where does it stand on Israel?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• What role has Hezbollah played in the recent Hamas escalated attack on Israel?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• How have the United States and other countries treated the group?\\n\\n• How does India see the Hezbollah group?\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍Israel-Hamas conflict: Who are Hezbollah, and why has their presence raised concerns of escalation?\\n\\nRussia passes law to withdraw from ratification of nuclear test ban treaty\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMains Examination: General Studies II: Effect of policies and politics of developed and developing countries on India’s interests,\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story- Russia’s parliament completed the passage of a law on Wednesday withdrawing ratification of the global treaty banning nuclear weapons tests, evidence of the deep chill in relations with the United States as Moscow pursues its war in Ukraine.\\n\\nDeputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia was not prepared to resume discussing nuclear issues with the U.S. unless Washington dropped its “hostile” policy.\\n\\n• Why Is Russia withdrawing from it?\\n\\n• But why this move by Russia now?\\n\\n• What exactly Russia said regarding the CTBT?\\n\\n• For Your Information-The bill to de-ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) was approved by 156 votes to zero in the upper house after the lower house also passed it unanimously. It now goes to President Vladimir Putin for signing.\\n\\nPutin had requested the change to “mirror” the position of the United States, which signed the CTBT in 1996 but never ratified it.\\n\\nThough it has never formally come into force, the CTBT has made nuclear testing a taboo – no country except North Korea has conducted a test involving a nuclear explosion this century.\\n\\n• What is Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty?\\n\\n• What is the purpose of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty?\\n\\n• How did CTBT come into being?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• For Your Information-The United States conducted the world’s first successful nuclear weapons test in July 1945. Four years later, the Soviet Union tested their first nuclear weapon. These tests triggered a decades-long arms race between the two superpowers. Between 1945 and 1996, more than 2,000 nuclear tests were carried out — 1,032 of them by the United States and 715 of them by the Soviet Union, according to the UN. Britain carried out 45 tests, France 210 and China 45.\\n\\n“The radioactive fallout from those tests drew criticism from around the globe. The international community’s concern about the effects on health and the environment continued to grow,” the US Department of State’s article, ‘History of CTBT’, said. As a result, several attempts to curb the explosive tests were made.\\n\\nThe 1963 Limited Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (LTBT) was one of the first such attempts. It prohibited nuclear testing in the atmosphere, outer space, and underwater, but underground tests were still permitted.\\n\\nTo tackle the limitations of LTBT, a comprehensive test ban was discussed during the negotiation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1968. However, no agreement was reached on the issue.\\n\\nSix years later, the US and Soviet Union agreed to sign the Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT), which established a nuclear “threshold” by banning the two countries from conducting tests that would produce a yield exceeding 150 kilotons (equivalent to 150,000 tons of TNT).\\n\\n“The mutual restraint imposed by the Treaty reduced the explosive force of new nuclear warheads and bombs, which could otherwise be tested for weapons systems. The TTBT was not intended as a substitute for a comprehensive test ban,” the article added.\\n\\nA major breakthrough only came after the Cold War ended around 1990 and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. As the geopolitical tensions simmered down, the UN took advantage of the situation and adopted the CTBT, which put a blanket ban on the explosive testing of nuclear weapons, on September 10, 1996, and it opened for signature on September 24, 1996.\\n\\n• Which key countries haven’t ratified CTBT?\\n\\n• Did US ratify CTBT?\\n\\n• India, USA, NPT and CTBT-Issues and India’s Apprehension\\n\\n• Did the CTBT stop nuclear testing?\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍Russia may pull out of CTBT: How the treaty tried — and failed — to stop nuclear testing\\n\\nEXPLAINED\\n\\nMahua case: process, precedent\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Indian Polity and Governance-Constitution, Political System, Panchayati Raj, Public Policy, Rights Issues, etc.\\n\\nMain Examination: General Studies II: Parliament and State legislatures—structure, functioning, conduct of business, powers & privileges and issues arising out of these.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story-BJP MP Nishikant Dubey and lawyer Jai Anant Dehadrai will appear before the Ethics Committee of Lok Sabha at noon on Thursday in connection with Dubey’s accusation, made in a letter to Speaker Om Birla earlier this month, that Trinamool Congress member Mahua Moitra accepted “bribes” to ask questions in Parliament targeting the Adani Group. The allegations by Dubey, which he has since taken to Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and the Lokpal, are based on information provided by Dehadrai, which were confirmed by real estate developer Darshan Hiranandani subsequently. Hiranandani, a resident of Dubai, has issued a “sworn affidavit” saying Moitra gave him her Parliament login and password so he could post questions on her behalf.\\n\\n• How serious is Nishikant Dubey’s accusation?\\n\\n• For Your Information-Essentially, the question is whether an MP is asking a question in return for some consideration, and whether there is illegal gratification involved. If this is established, then it is a serious issue.\\n\\nIf an MP has asked questions and has done other parliamentary work on behalf of somebody who has paid a consideration, then it should actually come to the Privileges Committee because it is a serious breach of privilege and contempt of the House. This is true for all countries that have a parliamentary system. In such a situation, Parliament can exercise its right to expel the member from the House.\\n\\n• What is exactly cash for query case?\\n\\n• Has there been an allegation earlier about an MP handing over access to the Parliament website to someone else?\\n\\n• Is there a rule that specifically bars Members from giving their Parliament login and password to a third person?\\n\\n• So is the Ethics Committee the right forum for a matter such as this?\\n\\n• What will happen once the Committee starts its proceedings on October 26?\\n\\n• What exactly is the Parliamentary Ethics Committee?\\n\\n• What is the primary role of the Ethics Committee?\\n\\n• For Your Information-The members of the Ethics Committee are appointed by the Speaker for a period of one year. The Committee is currently headed by the BJP’s Kaushambi MP Vinod Kumar Sonkar, and includes Vishnu Datt Sharma, Sumedhanand Saraswati, Aparajita Sarangi, Dr Rajdeep Roy, Sunita Duggal, and Dr Subhash Bhamre of the BJP; Ve Vaithilingam, N Uttam Kumar Reddy, and Preneet Kaur (Congress); Balashowry Vallabbhaneni (YSR Congress); Hemant Godse (Shiv Sena); Giridhari Yadav (JD-U); P R Natarajan (CPI-M); and Kunwar Danish Ali (BSP). A Presiding Officers’ Conference held in Delhi in 1996 first mooted the idea of ethics panels for the two Houses.\\n\\nThen Vice President (and Rajya Sabha Chairman) K R Narayanan constituted the Ethics Committee of the Upper House on March 4, 1997, and it was inaugurated that May to oversee the moral and ethical conduct of members and examine cases of misconduct referred to it. The Rules applicable to the Committee of Privileges also apply to the ethics panel.\\n\\nIn the case of Lok Sabha, a study group of the House Committee of Privileges, after visiting Australia, the UK, and the US in 1997 to look into practices pertaining to the conduct and ethics of legislators, recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee, but it could not be taken up by Lok Sabha.\\n\\nThe Committee of Privileges finally recommended the constitution of an Ethics Committee during the 13th Lok Sabha. The late Speaker, G M C Balayogi, constituted an ad hoc Ethics Committee in 2000, which became a permanent part of the House only in 2015.\\n\\nIn 2005, the two Houses adopted motions to expel 10 Lok Sabha MPs and one Rajya Sabha MP who were accused of agreeing to ask questions in Parliament for money. The motion in Lok Sabha was based on the report of a special committee set up by the Speaker under Chandigarh MP P K Bansal to examine the issue. In Rajya Sabha, the complaint was examined by the House Ethics Committee.\\n\\nThe BJP, which lost six MPs, demanded that the Bansal Committee’s report be sent to the Privileges Committee, so that the parliamentarians could defend themselves.\\n\\nFormer Lok Sabha Secretary General P D T Achary said there was “a lot of evidence” in the 2005 case — it was based on a sting operation — the challenge in the Mahua Moitra case will be to link the questions asked by the TMC MP to a money trail.\\n\\nAny person can complain against a Member through another Lok Sabha MP, along with evidence of the alleged misconduct, and an affidavit stating that the complaint is not “false, frivolous, or vexatious”. If the Member himself complains, the affidavit is not needed.\\n\\nThe Speaker can refer to the Committee any complaint against an MP.\\n\\nThe Committee does not entertain complaints based only on media reports or on matters that are sub judice. The Committee makes a prima facie inquiry before deciding to examine a complaint. It makes its recommendations after evaluating the complaint.\\n\\nThe Committee presents its report to the Speaker, who asks the House if the report should be taken up for consideration. There is also a provision for a half-hour discussion on the report.\\n\\n• How long could the Committee take to reach a decision and, should they find merit in the complaint, what is the maximum punishment it could recommend?\\n\\n• Could the Committee refer the matter to an investigative agency like the CBI or police?\\n\\n• Mahua Moitra has pointed out that the Ethics Committee has an “absolute majority of BJP members”-Comment\\n\\n• Can the MP appeal a potentially adverse decision in a court of law?\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍Cash for query: Echoes from 18 years ago when 11 MPs were expelled\\n\\n📍Mahua Moitra and ‘cash for query’ row: How MPs ask questions in Lok Sabha\\n\\nCUBISM\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: History of India and Indian National Movement\\n\\nMains Examination: General Studies I: History of the world will include events from 18th century such as industrial revolution, world wars, redrawal of national boundaries, colonization, decolonization, political philosophies like communism, capitalism, socialism etc.— their forms and effect on the society.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story-October 25 marks the 142nd birth anniversary of the renowned Spanish artist Pablo Picasso (1881-1973). His work consists of thousands of paintings, drawings, engravings, sculptures, and ceramics. In partnership with French painter George Braque (1882-1963), Picasso pioneered Cubism — a revolutionary visual art movement that began in 1907 and lasted till 1914. Although short-lived, Cubism was one of the most influential approaches to making art in the early 20th Century. It paved the way for the emergence of non-representational art movements, like Surrealism, and inspired artists like Marcel Duchamp, who pioneered conceptual art.\\n\\n• What is Cubism?\\n\\n• What inspired Cubism?\\n\\n• How did Cubism evolve?\\n\\n• What is Pablo Picasso’s famous for?\\n\\n• Was Pablo Picasso a Renaissance artist?\\n\\n• What was the impact of Picasso’s art?\\n\\n• Picasso had a significant influence on early Indian modernists who visited Europe in the 1950s, including F. N. Souza, Tyeb Mehta, and M. F. Husain, dubbed “India’s barefoot Picasso.” Can you elaborate impact of Picasso work on Indian artist?\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍Pablo Picasso’s changing oeuvre and how he was once accused of stealing Mona Lisa\\n\\nFRONT PAGE\\n\\nMumbai civic body bans garbage burning in the open, sends notices to 6,000 construction sites\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: General issues on Environmental ecology, Bio-diversity and Climate Change – that do not require subject specialization.\\n\\nMains Examination: General Studies III: Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation, environmental impact assessment.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story-On the day The Indian Express published a report on how Mumbai’s civic body took its eyes off the garbage dumping and its burning, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation ordered a complete ban on burning of garbage in the open. Earlier, the city’s Guardian Minister Deepak Kesarkar said the BMC had sent notices to 6,000 construction sites to install fogging machines and sprinklers. At a press conference Wednesday, Kesarkar also said the BMC is putting in place a process to soon start segregation of waste — extraction of pollutants from the garbage — at its two landfills in Deonar and Kanjurmarg. The new set of guidelines to mitigate air pollution announced by the BMC said, “There shall be a complete ban on open burning anywhere in the geographical area under BMC, especially garbage dumping grounds and possible sites of trash burning.”\\n\\n• The new set of guidelines to mitigate air pollution announced by the BMC-What are those?\\n\\n• Withdrawal of the southwest monsoon in Mumbai and a spike in the pollution burden on the city’s residents-Connect the dots\\n\\n• Why has the air quality been bad in Mumbai of late?\\n\\n• “Mumbai’s overall Air Quality Index touched 191, way worse than Delhi’s 84”-how this happened?\\n\\n• What are the reasons given by experts for the worsening AQI in Mumbai?\\n\\n• “Meteorological conditions play a role in pollution. But it should be clear that the weather or climate cannot generate air pollution. Air quality deteriorates mainly due to anthropogenic sources of emissions, whether local or distant. Meteorological conditions only help to manoeuvre the pollutants in the air”-Discuss\\n\\n• “Mumbai’s geography gives it a distinct advantage”-How?\\n\\n• “The “usual” is becoming “unusual” and getting triggered by additional anthropogenic factors”-Cite the reasons for Mumbai pollution\\n\\n• Do You Know-Last winter, the city experienced record-breaking particulate pollution, which was largely related to the unusual triple dip La Nina conditions — understood as linked to climate change. An abnormal drop in surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean had a telling effect on coastal wind speeds around Mumbai. There was scarcely any wind reversal from across the Arabian Sea, which would otherwise occur every two to three days and disperse pollutants in the air. In other words, the emission from various anthropogenic sources was not cleaned up and the city experienced its worst air of the decade.\\n\\nLa Nina has gone this year. However, the withdrawal of the monsoon was delayed till October. The withdrawal time of monsoon always plays a critical role in Mumbai’s air quality. The withdrawal is always followed by an anticyclonic circulation that was right above Mumbai and the surrounding regions during the initial days of October. This led to weak ventilation in the city.\\n\\nAt the same time, the transport level winds, much above the surface in the atmosphere, were moderately fast and were blowing towards Mumbai from Lonavala and Khandala in the Sahyadri ranges, around 2,040 ft above sea level. These chilly moderate winds are capable of transporting pollutants towards Mumbai. When these winds started losing energy, they descended near Navi Mumbai and the surrounding coastal region. There they encountered warmer winds which were laden with local dust. When this dust-filled cloud pushed towards Mumbai, it was arrested because of the calm winds, deteriorating the city’s air quality. The fact that PM10 continues to be the major pollutant in the city and the visibility of Mumbai’s residents has been impacted suggests that the major blame for the current worsening of air quality should be ascribed to coarser particles, largely a result of dust emissions.\\n\\nMany development and construction activities are being undertaken across the city — these include the coastal corridor, work on the Metro and other digging activities. Unfavourable weather conditions exploit the emissions from such sources to create pollution. Under normal conditions, windblown dust contributes 26 per cent of PM10 and 19 per cent in PM2.5. However, the spike in pollution indicates that PM10 levels have gone up significantly. Under normal conditions, the transport sector contributes to 14 per cent of PM10 and 31 per cent of PM2.5. However, the stagnating conditions are likely to have caused a change in this mix.\\n\\n• What is the AQI and how does it calculate pollution?\\n\\n• What is PM 2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres) and PM 10 (particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers)?\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍Burning trash, choking air: How Mumbai civic agencies took their eyes off waste mountain\\n\\n📍Behind Mumbai’s poor air\\n\\n📍MUMBAI ALARM BELLS\\n\\nContours of joint theatre commands ready, await Govt nod before tweaks\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance\\n\\nMains Examination: General Studies III: Various Security forces and agencies and their mandate.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story-The Armed Forces have narrowed down the final contours of the integrated theatre commands with a proposal for theatre commanders under a national defence committee likely to be headed by the Defence Minister, top officials have told The Indian Express.\\n\\n• What are integrated theatre commands?\\n\\n• For Your Information-In the simplest words, it is a unified command under which all the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force are pooled, depending on the threat perception.\\n\\nThe commands could be geographical — like looking at a border with a particular country — or thematic, like a command for all maritime threats.\\n\\nSeveral nations in the world have theatre commands, including the United States and China.\\n\\nThe idea of creating an integrated tri-Services command in India is not new — it had been recommended at various levels after the Kargil conflict.\\n\\nWhen Gen Rawat was appointed Chief of Defence Staff in January 2020 with a mandate to raise such commands within his three-year tenure, the idea was finally brought to the design table.\\n\\nAfter his appointment, Gen Rawat had commissioned studies within each of the armed forces to come up with ideas of what these commands could look like. These were headed by the Vice Chiefs of the forces.\\n\\nLast year, Gen Rawat had suggested that the first of these commands, the Air Defence Command, could come up by the end of 2020.

According to this report, by 2030, solar and wind will make up almost 51 per cent of total generation capacity (up from less than 20 per cent in 2019) and almost 31 per cent of all generated power (up from 8.3 per cent in 2019). If these projections materialise, they are likely to have major fiscal consequences for states.\\n\\nResearch by Sanjay Mitra and me zoom into the regional consequences of this RE build-out, and the accompanying expectation of greater RE procurement by state discoms. India’s massive RE build-out so far has largely benefited western and southern states. In August 2023, 92.5 per cent of all grid-connected RE generation came from eight states. This is largely driven by higher insolation and wind density but also bolstered by favourable state finances and investment environments.\\n\\nAssuming such patterns persist, RE-poor, coal-rich states are likely to face a double hit to state revenues: Coal royalties as a proportion of overall state revenue will decline as coal growth starts slowing later this decade, and the cost of power procurement will increase as new RE contracts are layered on top of existing commitments for firm power. Grid-scale energy storage technologies are still expensive and experimental, and are unlikely to be adopted at a large scale by the end of the decade. Since most coal-rich states have limited grid-scale RE-deployment, they will have to import more power from other states. This means that the quantum of inter-state financial transfers for power procurement will shoot up over the next decade. We find that the combined revenue impact of declining coal royalties and increasing electricity imports could worsen budget deficits of RE-poor power-importing states by almost 8.66 per cent on average, taking them well beyond the norms established by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management\\n\\nAct, 2003.\\n\\n• “The energy transition is no doubt complex”-why?\\n\\n• What is ‘Transition to clean energy’?\\n\\n• What is India’s energy transition plan?\\n\\n• What is India’s New Renewables Energy Target?\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍Transition without playbook\\n\\nEXPRESS NETWORK\\n\\nNCF sub-group suggestion to change ‘India’ to ‘Bharat’ not there in final document\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Indian Polity and Governance-Constitution, Political System, Panchayati Raj, Public Policy, Rights Issues, etc.\\n\\nMains Examination: General Studies II: Indian Constitution—historical underpinnings, evolution, features, amendments, significant provisions and basic structure.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story- One of the 25 focus groups set up by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) two years ago to provide inputs that would then feed into the new National Curriculum Framework (NCF) has suggested that ‘India’ should be renamed as ‘Bharat’ in social science textbooks.\\n\\n• What is the national curriculum framework?\\n\\n• Why ‘India’ should be renamed as ‘Bharat’ in social science textbooks?\\n\\n• What is “India, that is, Bharat, shall be a Union of States”?\\n\\n• What are the various arguments on ‘Bharat’ or ‘India’?\\n\\n• For Your Information-The first debate on Article 1 was to begin on November 17, 1948.

On September 17, 1949 Dr B R Ambedkar presented to the House the final version of the provision, which included both ‘Bharat’ and ‘India’. Several members expressed themselves against the use of ‘India’, which they saw as a reminder of the colonial past.\\n\\nSeth Govind Das from Jabalpur preferred to place Bharat over India. A popular demand by several members was also to underline that India was a substitute for Bharat in “English language”.\\n\\n“India, that is, Bharat” are not beautiful words for, the name of a country.

       " {'articleBody': 'On October 7, within hours of the armed group Hamas launching a surprise attack on Israel, social media platforms were rife with support for Israel – and also fake news.\\n\\nWhat stood out in the clamour was the fact that a fair amount of it was produced and distributed by accounts from India.\\n\\nIn the days after Israel declared war on Hamas, a blue-tick-verified handle posted a video on the social media platform X of a Pakistani parliamentarian threatening to obliterate Israel with an “atom bomb” if it did not end its atrocities against Muslims. That video received more than 840,000 views. But it was from 2021 and is not related to the current war.\\n\\nSimilarly, Suresh Chavhanke, editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News, a right-wing channel, shared a clip on X of an Israeli representative tearing up a 20-page United Nations report documenting human rights violations. That too was from 2021.\\n\\nExperts say the Israel-Hamas war has given a massive reach to social media accounts in India – both large and small – that have managed to ride a wave of anti-Muslim and pro-Israel fervour.\\n\\nApoorvanand, a Delhi University professor who goes by one name, perceives a link between current “anti-Muslim sentiment” and the rise of Hindu nationalist ideologies like Hindutva, particularly under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\\n\\nHindutva supporters, he said, “hold Muslims across countries responsible for all the ills and everything bad. They’ve started looking at Israel as an ideal, as a model to be followed because Israel does what it wants to do to Muslims”.\\n\\nA “generational shift” has taken place in India, said Nicolas Blarel, an associate professor of international relations at Leiden University in the Netherlands.\\n\\nOver the last decade, Blarel has observed that the country has grown more fascinated with Israel, including how it defends itself against attacks from its neighbours.\\n\\nThat situation has particular resonance in India, according to Blarel. In addition to border incursions from China in the east, India has also been subject to attacks on its western flank by what it says are state-supported armed groups in Pakistan. The two nuclear-armed nations have been locked in an ongoing conflict for control of the disputed territory of Kashmir.\\n\\nThose tense international relations have, in part, led Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to seek warmer relations with Israel.\\n\\n“Terrorism is the thing that’s brought the BJP closer to Israel over the last few years – how to better deal with counterterrorism,” said Blarel.\\n\\nAs a result, India’s political sphere has transformed from “an exclusive pro-Palestine ecosystem to the complete opposite and to one that is completely empathetic with [the] Israeli position” today, he explained.\\n\\nChanging relationships\\n\\nIndeed, India had supported Palestine’s right to statehood since 1947, when it gained independence from the United Kingdom.\\n\\nAt the time, the United Nations had proposed a “partition plan” to create separate Israeli and Palestinian states, something India objected to.\\n\\nThe plan never took effect, though. The very next year, Israel declared independence, sparking a conflict that would see the mass displacement of Palestinians.\\n\\nStill, in 1974, India became the first non-Arab country to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the “sole and legitimate representative” of the Palestinian people, continuing its pattern of support.\\n\\nAnd while New Delhi formally recognised Israel in 1950, it only normalised diplomatic relations in the early 1990s. Even then, it remained committed to the Palestinian cause and continued nurturing its relations with the Muslim-majority nations in the Middle East.\\n\\nHowever, in the past few years, India and Israel have started inching closer. The attacks in India’s financial capital Mumbai on November 26, 2008, helped spur the shift.\\n\\nMore than 160 people were killed and over 300 injured. A Jewish centre, the Nariman House, was among the targets: An Israeli American rabbi and his wife were among the six gunned down there. India blamed the attacks on a Pakistan-based armed group.\\n\\nTrade and innovation have also drawn the two countries together. When Modi was chief minister of Gujarat, he displayed his fascination for Israeli technologies including drip irrigation and water desalination, both useful for his state.\\n\\nIsrael has also been a supplier of arms to India, including during its 1999 skirmish with Pakistan in the Kashmiri region of Kargil. Israeli surveillance drones and mortar shells helped India emerge victorious in that conflict.\\n\\nMore recently, India was one of the countries accused of having bought Pegasus spyware from the Israeli cyber-intelligence firm NSO Group. Critics accuse the Modi government of deploying the spyware against judges, journalists, activists and political leaders, among others.\\n\\nExperts agree that the biggest shift in India’s foreign policy towards Israel has happened since Modi came to power in 2014. He became the first Indian prime minister to visit Israel in 2017.\\n\\nIn the wake of the Hamas attack on October 7, Modi has issued strong declarations in support of Israel. He initially tweeted, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families. We stand in solidarity with Israel.”\\n\\nIn a follow-up statement later that day, Modi added that “India strongly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations”.\\n\\nBut neither statement made any reference to the lives or plight of Palestinians. Only five days later did his government address the question of Palestinian relations: In response to a question during a routine media briefing, a spokesperson for the foreign minister said India’s stance on Palestine had not changed.\\n\\n“I was struck by Modi’s response to express solidarity with Israel and say nothing about Palestine at all,” said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington, DC. “Because India’s policy has been balanced so far.”\\n\\nThe statements showed “total support for Israel to defend itself”, according to Ashok Swain, head of the department of peace and conflict research at Uppsala University in Sweden.\\n\\nWhile New Delhi is now trying to maintain a more balanced position, those early statements showed that Modi is more interested in getting votes and appealing to his right-wing constituency, Swain added.\\n\\nThey send the message that Muslims are “the perpetrators of all sorts of crimes and less than human beings. They don’t talk about the Gaza situation or even who created Hamas”.\\n\\nSwain also sees the statements as a demonstration of the common ground Modi shares with far-right politicians in Israel.\\n\\n“Hindu nationalists and Zionists have an ideological similarity: They want a strong state and a strong leader,” he explained. “They also have a common factor – Islamophobia – which also binds them together.”\\n\\nSupport ratio of 5:1\\n\\nThose tensions played out on social media in the immediate aftermath of the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war.\\n\\nAt Al Jazeera’s request, the Narrative Research Lab in New Delhi scanned through trending hashtags and phrases in India on the social media platform X, to better understand how political narratives about the war were being shaped.\\n\\nThe phrase “We Indians” stood out partially because of the ongoing Cricket World Cup but also because of the conflict, said Sarabjot Singh, the lab’s co-founder.\\n\\n“We Indians” is an expression often invoked to stir nationalist pride. Using it as a keyword, Singh’s co-founder Sundeep Narwani used artificial intelligence to analyse a total of 4,316 tweets, of which 2,200 included words about the Israel-Hamas war.\\n\\nMore than 1,250 were pro-Israel, and approximately 250 were pro-Palestine, indicating a five-to-one ratio in favour of Israel.\\n\\nIn an attempt to gauge social media chatter, the lab also analysed two hashtags: “#IstandwithIsrael” and “#IsraelPalestineWar”. The former was used globally, but the lab found a “substantial” number of Indian accounts using it.\\n\\n“Issues that bring Modi and Netanyahu together are the same issues that make the Hindutva constituency in India gravitate towards Israel – admiring how Netanyahu has negotiated the neighbourhood with a strong stance,” said Kugelman.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': \"As Israel begins the first stages of Operation Swords of Iron in response to Hamas’s October 7 terrorist attacks, many questions have been raised about the moral and legal aspects of the war. In Gaza, units of the Israel Defense Forces will confront tens of thousands of heavily armed Hamas fighters deeply embedded in a large noncombatant population. Given this highly challenging setting, a core concern is how the IDF can effectively protect Israel, its citizens, and Israel’s own soldiers while adhering to moral principles, military ethical norms, and international law.\\n\\nSome have argued that Israel is not adhering to international laws of war. They assert that, in seeking to destroy Hamas’s military and political infrastructure, Israeli forces have disregarded the civilian populations in Gaza and are causing excessive collateral damage. In such a difficult war environment, some collateral damage is, unfortunately, unavoidable. But it is crucial to understand that Israel has a legal, moral, and ethical framework for approaching questions about conduct in war. This approach derives from basic principles of Israeli law, namely the obligation to respect and protect human dignity, international laws of war, and the IDF Code of Ethics, which has guided the conduct of Israeli commanders over the past three decades.\\n\\nBy setting down distinct parameters within which Israeli forces must operate—after the war as well as during it—Israeli war doctrine has significant implications for the operation against Hamas. Indeed, contrary to what some international commentators have claimed, Israel’s military response to the attacks so far has followed these standards, and the IDF has taken multiple steps to minimize collateral damage. Although the following should not be taken as the formal position of the Israeli government in the current crisis, it is an attempt to shed light on the major issues and the general way that Israel views them.\\n\\nA DIFFERENT KIND OF CONFLICT\\n\\nOn October 7, 2023, the last day of the annual Jewish high holidays, hundreds of Hamas fighters, along with members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller terrorist organization, invaded Israel, attacked more than 20 villages and towns, as well as IDF military bases, and committed horrendous atrocities. More than 1,500 noncombatants were brutally massacred, and some 220 Israelis—even babies and sick and elderly people—were abducted and taken hostage in Gaza. In addition, Hamas launched thousands of rockets at Israel, including at densely populated civilian areas in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. There is not a shred of doubt that these blatant acts of aggression fit the legal criteria of war crimes. Given the stated goal of destroying Israel, set forth in Hamas’s charter, it should come as no surprise that some observers have described the attacks as having genocidal intent.\\n\\nIn view of demonstrations in some Western cities and statements in the Western media calling for an immediate cease-fire, the nature of Hamas needs to be made clear. Hamas is a Palestinian militia that governs the Gaza Strip, between Israel and Egypt. Much of the West, including Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union, have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. This designation is based on the methods Hamas employs in pursuit of its goals. Some may regard those goals as justified, and others as immoral and unjustifiable, but those assessments are not relevant to the terrorist designation. Only the group’s methods count.\\n\\nHistorical parallels do not adequately fit the present situation.\\n\\nIn the days since the attacks, many have searched for historical parallels to try to make sense of the fathomless violence. Because Israel has witnessed no comparable act of terrorism in its 75-year history, some have looked back further in time or have tried to set aside the terrorist or anti-Semitic aspects of the attacks, viewing them instead as an extreme case of military aggression. Hence, commentators have variously invoked the anti-Jewish pogroms of eastern Europe more than a century ago, the Holocaust, and the surprise attack that began the 1973 Yom Kippur War.\\n\\nSuch parallels, however, do not adequately fit the present situation. The pogroms and the Holocaust took place at a time when Jews did not have their own nation-state, and the Yom Kippur War was launched by a state military rather than by a terrorist militia. The distinction between combatants and noncombatants, which can be easily maintained when a national military such as Egypt fights against Israel, is not maintained when a terrorist militia tries to use urban populations as a human shield. To understand the specific values and ethical norms that apply in Israeli actions against Hamas, then, these historical comparisons must be discarded.\\n\\nThe opening phase of Operation Swords of Iron is now unfolding. Israel’s war cabinet, which now consists of some government ministers and several opposition leaders, including some with significant military experience, has set and made public the broad goals of the war. The government has not offered many details about the kinds of force to be used, except for the high number of reservists—well over 350,000—who have been ordered to serve in a variety of military units. Nonetheless, it is possible to assess Israel’s overall approach by examining the general principles that will govern its conduct.\\n\\nA DUTY TO FIGHT\\n\\nThe state of Israel, including its courts and military commanders, has, over the course of its history, based military conduct on several kinds of values and ensuing norms. Some values stem from Israel’s status as a democratic country and as the nation-state of the Jewish people. The values of the IDF are expressed in its code of ethics. And some values come from international law, as interpreted by the Israeli legal system, led by the Supreme Court of Israel. Although these values derive from different moral, ethical, and legal sources, they combine to form two important general principles in the Israeli approach to combat operations.\\n\\nThe first principle is that any action taken on behalf of the Israeli state, including by its military and security forces, must be compatible with the universal obligation to respect and protect human dignity. A simple example is the requirement to treat captured enemy combatants humanely in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. This principle thus provides a moral, ethical, and legal constraint on military conduct.\\n\\nThe second principle, which can be called the self-defense principle, has two parts. First, it encompasses the right to self-defense if the state or any of its inhabitants is subject to armed attack; second, it provides that the state has a duty to defend its citizens when they are under direct attack.\\n\\nIsrael has a duty to defend its citizens against potential future attacks.\\n\\nIndeed, Israel and other countries have interpreted the duty to defend citizens enshrined in the second part of this principle to hold not only for current or imminent attacks, but also for potential future attacks, even if they are not expected soon. The time for a state to create means of defense is not when its citizens already face danger, but much earlier—an imperative generally recognized by governments everywhere. In turn, how this defense is carried out when the danger is neither present nor imminent depends on the nature of the future danger.\\n\\nThe Hamas attacks have triggered both parts of the self-defense principle. Israel’s military operation in Gaza stems from what it views as the state’s right to take necessary action to defend itself and its inhabitants, and its duty to protect the latter against not only the present attack but also continuing threats from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken underscored this point during his visit to Tel Aviv on October 16, when he said, “Israel has the right and indeed the duty to defend its people from Hamas and other terrorists and to prevent future attacks.”\\n\\nThus, the answer to the “why” question of Israel’s military response is now clear: to satisfy the self-defense principle, Israel needs to go beyond the reestablishment of security on its border with Gaza and eliminate the possibility of any future such attacks. But the “how” question—how Israeli forces will carry out this task—is more difficult. Israel’s war cabinet has instructed the IDF to destroy the military and governmental abilities of Hamas in Gaza. But what does that mean in practice?\\n\\nPREVENTIVE ACTION\\n\\nTo understand the major goal the IDF has set for Operation Swords of Iron according to Israeli principles of war, it is necessary to distinguish between two kinds of self-defense. Examples of the first kind are familiar since we encounter them in ordinary, everyday circumstances. Say, for example, you are crossing a park, and someone approaches you and tries to snatch your wallet. You forcefully resist the person, who then runs away. In this case, the structure of the encounter is clear: the would-be thief created a problem, you used some force, and the problem was solved.\\n\\nA military attack, however, often takes on a different cast. The use of defensive force may stop the attack, thus ending the immediate danger, but the problem has not been fully solved. The unit that launched the attack may have pulled back, but it can regroup and launch another one later. Under such a continuing threat, self-defense must have a wider scope. In the event of a terrorist attack sponsored by a de facto governing authority, as was the case with Hamas’s murderous rampage, the attacked state may need to broaden that scope further.\\n\\nThe Israeli war cabinet has instructed the IDF to dismantle both the military and the governmental capabilities of Hamas. In taking on such a goal, Israel is performing self-defense in a broader sense. The problem Israel faces now is continued exposure to a terrorist threat. Hamas’s attack on Israel and its citizens clearly shows the gravity of this danger: it will persist as long as Hamas’s organization in Gaza, run by Yahya Sinwar, is extant. Thus, Israel has concluded that the only viable solution to the problem is the complete elimination of Hamas’s political and military wings.\\n\\nIsraeli soldiers training for urban warfare, Golan Heights, October 2023 Gil Eliyahu / Reuters\\n\\nThe spokesperson for the IDF has explained the general goals of this eradication operation. In its attack on Israel, Hamas killed more than 1,500 Israeli citizens, injured more than 5,400, and abducted some 220 of them, including numerous foreign nationals; every building or site that Hamas used in those attacks, or in support of those attacks, must be destroyed. In other words, Hamas facilities that ostensibly serve other governmental functions in Gaza may be assumed to provide infrastructure for planning and launching future attacks. Effectively solving the Hamas problem therefore includes the eradication of its political offices as well.\\n\\nThe IDF spokesperson has also stated that every member of Hamas who was involved in planning or carrying out the October 7 attack must be killed. Israel’s Supreme Court assessed the legality of targeted killing operations in a 2006 decision, which in turn was based on international law considerations, as well as the ethical doctrine developed within the framework of the IDF. (I am one of the doctrine’s co-authors.) The court found targeted killing to be lawful under certain strict conditions, including considerations of proportionality. In the case of the October 7 attacks, however, more than 1,000 perpetrators managed to escape back into Gaza, and an Israeli operation aimed at eliminating all of them, or even many of them, in targeted killing missions is impractical, given the strict requirement to avoid or minimize collateral damage set by the Israeli Supreme Court, the IDF Code of Ethics, and the basic Israeli principle to protect human dignity.\\n\\nGiven this reality, the IDF’s declared intent to kill all perpetrators means in practice that it will pursue the leading figures, because they continue to pose grave danger to Israel and its citizens. All other perpetrators will be designated as threats, as well, based on their affiliation with Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad and their participation in the attacks. They will not enjoy a life of tranquility. But Israel may need to address the danger they pose to its citizens later, not necessarily during the present war. Strictly speaking, the goal of the present operation is to destroy Hamas’s ability to launch military attacks against Israel and its ability to control Gaza; the goal is not to kill every member of Hamas.\\n\\nSELF DEFENSE, NOT REVENGE\\n\\nIsrael’s operation in Gaza should not be depicted as, or justified on the grounds of, revenge. No principle of “an eye for an eye” should guide Israel’s pursuit of Hamas and its members. The major principle at issue, according to Israel’s own conception of war conduct, is self-defense. In particular, the civilian population of Gaza should not be subject to acts of revenge, which are clearly immoral and, as a form of collective punishment, also illegal.\\n\\nNonetheless, a large-scale operation to dismantle the terrorist organization that controls Gaza is bound to involve numerous interactions with inhabitants who are not involved in the hostilities. Such interactions must be guided by three principles, the first of which also underlies the second and third. The first is that the IDF must continually try to minimize collateral damage. Obviously, this imperative applies to the Israeli population as well, but in the present operation, its primary application concerns the issue of collateral damage in the Gaza Strip, and the obligation to protect the life, health, and property of noncombatants who live there under Hamas control. Here, two further principles come into play: the principle of distinction and the principle of proportionality. Both are well established as components of historical “just war” doctrine (jus ad bellum) and, since the twentieth century, have been inscribed in international law, as well.\\n\\nOne way the IDF has long sought to minimize collateral harm is by warning civilians of imminent military attacks. In previous operations in Gaza, for example, the IDF alerted inhabitants to evacuate areas by employing “knocking on the roof” warnings shortly before it attacked: with this method and others, including phone calls, inhabitants would be given multiple warnings of an attack, the more the better. But under the present circumstances, this approach is no longer possible, given the scale of the operation and the number of Hamas targets involved.\\n\\nIDF units must continue to try to prevent harm to noncombatants who have not evacuated.\\n\\nInstead, on October 13, the IDF issued a general order to noncombatant inhabitants who live in the northern part of Gaza to move to the southern part, since the next stage of hostilities will take place in the north. Such a large-scale evacuation is required because Hamas has embedded itself and its operations in residential areas, and it would be impossible for the IDF to act effectively, systematically, and forcefully against Hamas without harming noncombatants there.\\n\\nIn this situation, the general evacuation order can serve the purpose of the roof-knocking warnings. Given the magnitude of Hamas’s October 7 attacks and Israel’s clear announcement that it is compelled to make a devastating military response, it is reasonable to assume that all inhabitants of Gaza are aware of the situation. In addition to Israeli and international media, Palestinian radio and TV stations have extensively covered these events. Often the IDF breaks into their programs to warn the population. Residents thus understand the need to evacuate. Nonetheless, the IDF has followed the evacuation order with other forms of warning.\\n\\nMoreover, the IDF’s guidelines require that its forces must distinguish between terrorist combatants and noncombatants who have not yet evacuated. Israeli units must continue to try to prevent harm to the latter. By and large, the presence of such noncombatants should be known to the IDF and, to the extent possible, should be taken into account when it plans and carries out military activity.\\n\\nTHE DAMAGE THRESHHOLD\\n\\nWhich brings us to the principle of proportionality. Since it is Hamas policy to blur all distinctions between its members and the general population of Gaza, an Israeli attack on a Hamas military target often risks causing collateral damage, even when extensive precautions are taken. The international press and Western commentators often assume that if any noncombatants are killed in such operations, then excessive force has been used. That assumption is flawed.\\n\\nOf course, all noncombatant casualties are regrettable, and every effort should be made to minimize them. According to the principle of proportionality as elaborated in just war doctrine, however, the crucial issue is whether the value of the military advantage gained is greater than the cost of the expected collateral damage. If it is, then the act in question can be justified. This holds important implications for the present war against Hamas. Israel must seek to minimize collateral damage as much as is reasonably possible. But according to Israel’s own self-defense principle, given the kind of threat that Hamas poses—and given Israel’s resulting need to eliminate the political and military infrastructure of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad—it is necessary to establish a clear limit for collateral damage. How should this determination be made?\\n\\nSuch proportionality considerations can be complicated, but the IDF has used a specific process for making them for the past three decades. Finding the correct balance involves deep and intricate moral, ethical, and legal analysis. To grasp the underlying principles that determine what level of collateral damage is acceptable, it is useful to first consider extreme cases. Take, for example, an enemy site that is being used to prepare an imminent attack that would kill hundreds of people. Destroying the site would likely cause the death of a few noncombatants who are not involved in terror activities, but any reasonable analysis would conclude that the destruction of the site is warranted. For an example on the other extreme, consider a situation in which defense forces are targeting a facility containing enemy rockets that are not being used in a current attack but could be used in the future. Let’s say a pilot approaches the site to destroy it but sees a bus, full of children, in the vicinity. Since there is no urgent need to destroy the magazine and the mission can be carried out later, it is clear that the strike should be called off.\\n\\nAn IDF soldier near Israel's border with Lebanon, October 2023 Lisi Niesner / Reuters\\n\\nTo acquire a fuller understanding of how proportionality is calculated, however, it is necessary to move from these clear-cut cases at each extreme toward the center, where enlarging the military advantage of a given action may also require greater collateral damage. There is no quantitative formula for making such determinations. But qualitative considerations are critical, including the extent and immediacy of the threat that is being acted against and the orders of magnitude of potential casualties if that threat is carried out, as well as the expected collateral damage if the threat is neutralized.\\n\\nIt is also important to stress that the IDF does not base its determination of the legitimacy of a given action solely on proportionality considerations. According to Israeli principles of conduct, the IDF is obliged to minimize collateral damage, even if causing such damage is permissible under the principle of proportionality. Hence, the IDF aborts a large percentage of its sorties because it determines that it can cause less collateral damage by carrying out the mission under different circumstances.\\n\\nFinally, bringing troops back home is an advantage that should never be disregarded or undervalued in proportionality considerations. The principle of upholding human dignity must also apply to people in military uniform. According to Israeli doctrine, part of the military advantage of a given action must include the extent to which that action minimizes IDF casualties.\\n\\nRULES AFTER ENGAGEMENT\\n\\nMuch discussion has centered on how Israel should treat the population of Gaza in relation to the major goal of eradicating Hamas. Immediately following the attack, the Israeli government announced that it was cutting off electricity, water, food, and fuel to Gaza. It is true that the enemy can use fuel and electricity for both civil and military purposes, but cutting off food and water is wrong, because it is incompatible with established ethical principles.\\n\\nAdding to the complexity of the operation is the issue of the more than 200 people that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad abducted and took to Gaza. This problem demands further analysis of its own, but it is worth underscoring the prime importance of securing the release of these hostages, both on ethical and political-military grounds.\\n\\nAnother key aspect of the conduct of Israel’s war against Hamas has been largely neglected. When Hamas is destroyed and Palestinian Islamic Jihad is eliminated, what then?\\n\\nIsraeli reoccupation or annexation of Gaza is utterly unacceptable.\\n\\nIn its advanced versions, just war doctrine includes norms and principles governing conduct not only during war but also once the fighting ends, under what is known as jus post bellum. According to the latter principles, reoccupation or annexation of Gaza by Israel is utterly unacceptable. Instead, what needs to take place is restoring security in the areas of Israel adjacent to Gaza; and then establishing peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians based on some agreement with respect to temporary borders. Any policies that involve population transfer, long-term occupation, or bringing the territory directly under Israeli rule would be incompatible with either of these goals.\\n\\nTo build a new peace in Gaza, creative alternatives must be sought, perhaps even some first steps toward a solution of the wider Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the near term, the only plausible option would be the introduction of some multinational military and governmental authority, international or regional, which could be created by a UN Security Council resolution and that would act in cooperation with the Palestinian Authority and in coordination with Israel.\\n\\nWhatever arrangements are made, they should not be taken as an ultimate solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The spirit of the two-state solution will need to be revived and allowed to prevail, through the introduction and implementation of confidence-building measures over a longer timeline. But the full elimination of the terrorist threat from Hamas and affiliated groups could do much to set this process in motion. Policies of pursuing lasting peace, all the more so policies in the spirit of the two-state solution, must rest on the practical assumption that the dangers to Israel and its citizens, as nurtured and practiced by terrorist organizations, have been permanently eliminated.\",\n",

We must without equivocation denounce antisemitism. We must also without equivocation denounce Islamophobia,” he declared.\\n\\nAntisemitism is a certain perception of the followers of the Judaism religion or Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews.\\n\\nRhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\\n\\nApartheid\\n\\nLast week, in a post on their X account, Iran’s mission to the United Nations warned that if “Israeli apartheid’s war crimes and genocide” are not stopped then the situation could spiral out of control with “far-reaching consequences.”\\n\\nThe apartheid refers to a policy or system of segregation or discrimination. In the case of South Africa, it was the racial segregation under the all-white government of South Africa which dictated that non-white South Africans (a majority of the population) were required to live in separate areas from whites and use separate public facilities, and contact between the two groups would be limited. The different racial groups were physically separated according to their location, public facilities and social life.\\n\\nBalfour Declaraion\\n\\nThe Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 expressing support for the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine, that was then part of the Ottoman Empire. The declaration was named after Arthur Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary at the time.\\n\\nPalestinians argue that the declaration disregarded the rights and aspirations of the Arab population living in Palestine at the time. It remains a controversial document that played a pivotal role in the creation of the Israeli state in 1948.\\n\\nEsteemed Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said stressed that the declaration “was made by a European power about a non-European territory in a flat disregard of both the presences and the wishes of the native majority resident in that territory, and it took the form of a promise about this same territory to another foreign group, that this foreign group might, quite literally, make this territory a national home for the Jewish people”.\\n\\nBoycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)\\n\\nThe Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) is a Palestinian civil society movement that aims to end international support for Israel’s oppression of Palestinians. Taking inspiration from the South African anti-apartheid struggle, the BDS initiative hopes to exert pressure on Israel, encouraging its adherence to international laws.\\n\\nBoycotts encompass the withdrawal of support from Israel’s regime, complicit Israeli institutions and international companies engaged in actions that violate Palestinian human rights. Divestment campaigns seek the disinvestment of funds from Israel and companies that contribute to Israeli apartheid.\\n\\nSanctions campaigns aim to compel governments by banning business with illegal Israeli settlements, ending military and free-trade agreements and suspending Israel’s membership in international forums such as UN bodies and FIFA.\\n\\nIn the UK, an anti-BDS bill is being proposed that is designed to stop councils and other public authorities from conducting boycotts, divestment and sanctions campaigns against Israel.\\n\\nColonialism\\n\\nColonialism is a practice of domination, which involves the subjugation of one people to another and is frequently used to describe the settlement of North America, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, India and Brazil, places that were controlled by a large population of permanent European residents.\\n\\nThe term colony comes from the Latin word colonus, meaning farmer which tells us that the practice of colonialism usually involved the transfer of population to a new territory, where the arrivals lived as permanent settlers while maintaining political allegiance to their country of origin.\\n\\nEthnic cleansing\\n\\n“Israel has already carried out mass ethnic cleansing of Palestinians under the fog of war,” Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Palestine has warned.\\n\\n“Again, in the name of self-defence, Israel is seeking to justify what would amount to ethnic cleansing,” she said.\\n\\nEthnic cleansing is a well-defined policy of a particular group of persons to systematically eliminate another group from a given territory on the basis of religious, ethnic or national origin. Such a policy involves violence and is very often connected with military operations.\\n\\nGaza Strip\\n\\nGaza is a coastal strip of land that lies on ancient trading and maritime routes along the Mediterranean shore. Held by the Ottoman Empire until 1917, it passed from British to Egyptian to Israeli military rule over the last century and is now a fenced-in enclave inhabited by over 2m Palestinians.\\n\\nGenocide\\n\\nEarlier this month, caretaker Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani slammed Israel for “committing a genocide” against Palestinians.\\n\\nArticle 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of the United Nations defines genocide as: “any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.”\\n\\nGolan Heights\\n\\nThe Golan Heights is a rocky plateau in south-western Syria, about 60km (40 miles) southwest of Damascus and covers about 1,000 sq km. It has a political and strategic significance which belies its size.\\n\\nCourtesy Wikipedia.\\n\\nIsrael seized the Golan Heights from Syria in the closing stages of the 1967 Six-Day War. Most of the Syrian Arab inhabitants fled the area during the conflict. Israel’s 1981 annexation was not globally recognised and Syria demands the return of its territory.\\n\\nThe area became a point of contention once again when Israeli strikes reportedly killed two people near the Syrian town of Beit Jinn in Israeli-occupied Golan Heights recently.\\n\\nGreat March of Return\\n\\nBetween March 2018 and December 2019, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip held the “Great March of Return” (GMR) demonstrations, demanding the right of Palestinian refugees to their villages and towns in what is now Israel and the cessation of the Israeli blockade.\\n\\nThese demonstrations involved thousands of participants who would gather every Friday and on specific occasions at five designated points along the border fence. Additionally, smaller protests occurred during the week at the beach and at various locations near the fence at night.\\n\\nThe UN says that about 1.4m people have been displaced in Gaza in the current conflict — which is over 60 per cent of the entire strip’s population.\\n\\nAccording to Article 13 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, “everyone has the right […] to return to his country”.\\n\\nHebron Protocol\\n\\nThe Hebron Protocol was an agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) signed in 1997. It aimed to address security and administrative arrangements in the city of Hebron, located in the West Bank.\\n\\nThe protocol divided Hebron into two areas: H1, which was placed under Palestinian Authority control, and H2, which remained under Israeli military control.\\n\\nEnglish language website The New Arab describes Hebron city in the West Bank as a “microcosm of Israel’s occupation”.\\n\\nHolocaust\\n\\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told US Presiden Joe Biden that Hamas’ atrocities on Oct 7 were the “worst since the Holocaust”.\\n\\nThe Holocaust was the systematic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million European Jews by the Nazi German regime and its allies and collaborators. The Holocaust was an evolving process that took place throughout Europe between 1933 and 1945.\\n\\nIntifada\\n\\nThe Arabic term intifada, literally means “shaking off,” when applied to conflicts usually takes on the meaning of an “uprising”, “popular resistance”, or “rebellion”\\n\\nThe first Intifada began in December 1987 after a traffic accident in which an Israeli truck crashed into a vehicle carrying Palestinian workers in Gaza’s Jabalya refugee camp, killing four. Stone-throwing protests, strikes and shutdowns followed. It ended with the Madrid Conference in 1991, although some date its formal termination as 1993 with the onset of the Oslo Accords. At least 1,500 Palestinians and 400 Israelis were killed in the violence.\\n\\nPalestinian school girls returning home from classes pass a line of Arab men being frisked by Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip in 1986 after a Jewish man was stabbed and seriously injured. —Reuters\\n\\nThe second or al-Aqsa Intifada began in 2000, and, while many of its actions and effects are still playing out today, most authorities assign an end date of July 2005. At least 3,000 Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis were killed in the ensuing violence.\\n\\nPalestinian police exchange fire with Israeli soldiers during clashes near Netzreem Jewish settlement in Gaza Strip, October 2000. —Reuters\\n\\nA recent Dawn report said that Palestinian deaths from the Israeli siege of Gaza are the most that Palestine has ever witnessed, exceeding the first and second intifada combined.\\n\\nIron Dome\\n\\nOn Oct 24, a senior defence official announced that the Pentagon is increasing its support for Israel by supplying them with complete Iron Dome air defence systems.\\n\\n—Via IDF\\n\\nThe Iron Dome is a part of Israel’s defence system. It is designed to shoot down incoming rockets. Developed between 2007 and 2011, the dome has a success rate of 95.6pc, according to the IDF.\\n\\nIslamophobia\\n\\nIslamophobia is an extreme fear of and hostility toward Islam and Muslims which often leads to hate speech, hate crimes, as well as social and political discrimination.\\n\\nAccording to Georgetown University’s Bridge Initiative, a multi-year it can be used to rationalise policies such as mass surveillance, incarceration, and disenfranchisement, and can influence domestic and foreign policy.\\n\\nIslamophobia was originally developed as a concept in the late 1990s by political activists to draw attention to rhetoric and actions directed at Islam and Muslims in Western liberal democracies.\\n\\nThe UN observes March 15 as the international day to combat Islamophobia.\\n\\nIsrael Defence Forces (IDF)\\n\\nThe Israel Defence Forces (IDF) serves as the primary military organisation of the State of Israel. It comprises three distinct branches: the Israeli Ground Forces, the Israeli Air Force, and the Israeli Navy.\\n\\nIt has said it would intensify strikes on Gaza ahead of a planned ground invasion, as UN agencies warned of a “catastrophic” humanitarian situation in the blockaded territory.\\n\\nKibbutz\\n\\nOn Oct 7, Hamas fighters attacked a music festival which was held in a field outside the Re’im kibbutz, about 5.3km from the wall separating Gaza and southern Israel.\\n\\nA kibbutz (plural: kibbutzim) is a communal settlement in Israel that is owned and shared equally by the people who live there and run it. The first kibbutz was founded in 1909; currently, there are about 270, with a total population exceeding 120,000. Adults live in private quarters, while children are generally housed and cared for as a group.\\n\\nNakba\\n\\nThe mass evacuation of Palestinians has given Gazans memories of the “Nakba”.\\n\\nThe Nakba, or “catastrophe”, refers to the mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians during the Arab-Israeli war of 1948, which has been likened to the “ethnic cleansing of Palestine and the near-total destruction of Palestinian society”.\\n\\nThe creation of Israel entailed the forced expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homeland to establish a Jewish-majority state.\\n\\nArab villagers fleeing from an unidentified area in the Galilee in October 1948.—Reuters\\n\\nBetween 1947 and 1949, at least 750,000 Palestinians from a 1.9m population were made refugees beyond the borders of the state.\\n\\nNaksa\\n\\nAl Naksa or the Naksa, also known as the day of “defeat” or “setback”, is observed by Palestinians on June 5 each year.\\n\\nSimilar to Nakba, it commemorates the displacement of Palestinians that occurred during the Six Day War in 1967, which resulted in Israel’s occupation of the rest of historically Palestinian areas of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip as well as the Syrian Golan Heights and Egyptian Sinai Peninsula.\\n\\nDestroyed Egyptian armour lines the sides of a Sinai road after it was hit by Israeli jet fighters during the 1967 Six Day War.—Reuters\\n\\nNeocolonialism\\n\\nNeocolonialism is a process by which former colonising countries exploit the rules and regulations of their former colonies that are now independent, underdeveloped or less developing, for indirect domination.\\n\\nPredominantly neocolonialism has been noticed in economics, although this economic exploitation is intertwined with political and cultural exploitation.\\n\\nOslo Accords\\n\\nIsraeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman Yasir Arafat on 13 September 1993, redrew the geopolitical map of the entire region when they signed the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Governing Arrangements (DOP) for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, marking one of the most momentous events in the twentieth-century history of the Middle East.\\n\\nThe DOP was signed in Washington, with President Bill Clinton acting as master of ceremonies, but it had been negotiated in Oslo and initiated there in late August.\\n\\nThe first part was mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO. The second part, the Declaration of Principles, set an agenda for negotiations on Palestinian self-government in the occupied territories, beginning with Gaza and Jericho.\\n\\nThirty years later, the goals of these accords remain unachieved.\\n\\nPalestine Liberation Organisation (PLO)\\n\\nThere are currently two governments in control of the Palestine territories. Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO)/Fatah governs the West Bank region whereas Hamas is in control of Gaza.\\n\\nThe PLO, established in 1964 as a coalition of resistance groups, political parties, and various Palestinian civil society organisations, achieved global recognition as the “sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people” by the mid-1970s.\\n\\nThe PLO had agreed to end its policy of armed resistance and, as a result, the PLO’s presence and government were recognised by the international community.\\n\\nDuring the 1996 elections, the electorate handed the PLO a landslide victory and the mandate to rule the West Bank and Gaza. However, the 2007 armed conflict between PLO and Hamas in Gaza led to the ouster of the PLO from Gaza.\\n\\nRafah crossing\\n\\nThe Rafah crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt’s Sinai region is the sole route for aid to enter Gaza directly from outside Israel and the only exit that does not lead to Israeli territory.\\n\\nThe crossing is controlled by Egypt.\\n\\nIt has become a focus in the intensifying conflict between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have headed towards south Gaza after Israel warned them to leave Gaza City and the enclave’s north.\\n\\nThe only likely route for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza is via Rafah from Egypt’s Sinai region. It is also the only exit point for Gaza residents seeking to flee.\\n\\nEgypt is wary of insecurity near the border with Gaza in northeastern Sinai, where it faced an insurgency that peaked after 2013 and has now largely been suppressed.\\n\\nSettler colonialism\\n\\nIsrael’s occupation is illegal and indistinguishable from a “settler-colonial” situation, which must end, as a pre-condition for Palestinians to exercise their right to self-determination, the UN’s independent expert on the occupied Palestinian territory told the UN General Assembly last year.\\n\\nSettler colonialism is an ongoing system of power that perpetuates the genocide and repression of indigenous peoples and cultures.\\n\\nEssentially hegemonic in scope, settler colonialism normalises the continuous settler occupation, exploiting lands and resources to which indigenous peoples have genealogical relationships. Settler colonialism includes interlocking forms of oppression, including racism, white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, and capitalism.\\n\\nShebaa Farms\\n\\nThe Shebaa Farms is a disputed region between Lebanon and Israel situated near the Hermon mountain range at the Lebanon-Syria border.\\n\\nThe Shebaa Farms were seized by Israel during the 1967 Middle East conflict and are a part of Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Syria and Lebanon, on the other hand, claim that it belongs to Lebanon’s territory.\\n\\nThere have been conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon at their border.

       " {'articleBody': \"With Mike Johnson, a Republican representative from Louisiana, an ally of Donald Trump who backed his claims about the 2020 election being “stolen”, a staunch Far-Right figure who celebrated the US Supreme Court verdict overturning Roe V Wade, and an evangelical Christian, elected as the new Speaker of the US House of the Representatives, the American legislature has entered unchartered territory. On his first full day on the job, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., makes a statement to reporters about the mass shooting in Maine, at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Oct. 26, 2023. He did not respond to questions. (AP)\\n\\nALSO READ- After 3 weeks US House gets a Speaker, Trump aide Mike Johnson secures majority GOP support\\n\\nJohnson will now have to keep the Republicans united in the House and please his patron, Trump, while also addressing governance requirements which entails the House to pass relevant spending bills and collaborate with the Democratic administration or risk a a government shutdown. He will also have to navigate both issues of convergence between parties such as American support for Israel and divergences such as American support for Ukraine.\\n\\nIf Johnson sticks to his Far-Right inclinations, American polity is headed for a prolonged impasse and deepening of tensions between the legislature and the executive. If he displays an accommodative stance, which is unlikely, Johnson risks losing his already limited political capital and base at a time when even a single member of the House can seek to oust the Speaker. The fact that there is only a year to go for the presidential elections means that politically competitive instincts in the House are peaking on all sides of the aisle and the room for compromise is diminishing.\\n\\nThe backdrop\\n\\nJohnson’s election on Wednesday — 220 members backed him while 209 opposed him in the House — came three weeks after Republican Far-Right members ousted Kevin McCarthy as Speaker for what they saw as too accommodative an approach towards the Democratic administration.\\n\\nSince then, despite multiple rounds of voting, the Republicans had failed to elect a Speaker, either because moderates rejected far-Right candidates (such as Jim Jordan, the co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus) or because the Far-Right rejected more moderate candidates (such as Steven Scalise and Tom Emmer).\\n\\nBut the prolonged delay in electing a Speaker was denting Republican credibility and had led to a sense of fatigue among the members, besides giving Democrats an opportunity to showcase the GOP as a force in disarray and incapable of governing. The mood on Capitol Hill was one of frustration, with the Republicans eventually consolidating behind Johnson and giving the Far-Right a major triumph.\\n\\nThe man and his politics\\n\\nJohnson, 51, is a generally low-key figure in the Republican Party, who is most prominent for his extreme positions on a range of political and cultural positions that have divided America.\\n\\nHe was among the key figures in the House backing Trump’s claims on the 2020 elections and led an effort to the block the certification of the results. He opposed investigating the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. He opposes same sex relationships and marriages and has pushed policies to restrict pedagogy around sexuality for children in federally funded institutions. He was the chairman of the arch-conservative Republican Study Committee.\\n\\nJohnson and his wife are devout Christians. He has pushed many bills restricting abortion access nationally and welcomed the Roe v Wade verdict that ended national protection to abortion. And he is close to the oil and gas lobby, putting him firmly against climate action advocates.\\n\\nThe challenges\\n\\nJohnson has to now both deal with an administration request for $105 billion for national security funding especially for Ukraine and Israel, and deal with the prospects of a federal government shutdown from November 17 unless the House passes the relevant appropriations bills.\\n\\nMcCarthy had enabled the passage of a continuing resolution that allowed the government to stay open, but this is what triggered the rebellion from the far-Right of his own party. Trump, who is exercising his power and influence in shaping the House dynamics, is seen as pushing for a shutdown and believes this will be blamed on his arch rival, President Joe Biden. Trump called Johnson a “fantastic gentleman” who will do a “great job” on Wednesday.\\n\\nSoon after his victory, Johnson said that sending aid to Israel, fixing the southern border, and reining in federal spending as his top priorities. In a statement on Wednesday, Biden congratulated Johnson and said he would work in good faith with the Speaker. “We need to move swiftly to address our national security needs and to avoid a shutdown in 22 days. Even though we have real disagreements about important issues, there should be mutual effort to find common ground wherever we can.”\\n\\nFinding that common ground is going to be exceedingly hard, for if Donald Trump’s rise represented the elevation of American Far-Right in the executive branch, Mike Johnson’s rise represents the elevation of the uncompromising and extreme American Far-Right in the legislative branch. Biden, who is battling multiple external and internal crises, will have to deal with a new interlocutor and a new, more challenging situation than that existed when McCarthy was speaker. All signs point to continued dysfunctionality and disruption in the governance matrix of the US.\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE ON\\n\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR Prashant Jha Prashant Jha is the Washington DC-based US correspondent of Hindustan Times.

Since Palestinian militant group Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7, Lebanon\\'s southern border has seen tit-for-tat exchanges between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah, a Hamas ally. The Mayor of the border village of Alma al-Shaab, Jean Ghafari, said the fire broke out after an Israeli bombing late Wednesday. \"The blaze reached the edges of the village after midnight\" and is still burning, he told AFP, adding that it \"has come close to houses\".ADVERTISEMENTgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1576647220-9\");}); Security forces, civil defence personnel, United Nations peacekeepers and volunteers were battling the blaze but \"have been unable to completely control it because of strong winds\", Ghafari added. The municipality said some 70 per cent of the village\\'s population had fled due to Israeli attacks. An AFP photographer saw fire near houses on the outskirts of Alma al-Shaab and burnt olive trees, with the blaze mainly concentrated between the village and the coastal city of Naqura. \"Overnight (Israeli) bombing with phosphorus led to the fire, which has affected a broad forested area and spread due to the high winds,\" Naqura mayor Abbas Awada told AFP in a statement. In recent weeks, Lebanon\\'s official National News Agency and Lebanese paramedics have reported fires and injuries due to white phosphorus, while Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of using the incendiary weapon in its war against Hamas militants in Gaza, and in southern Lebanon. Israel has denied the allegations. READ THE LIVE UPDATES OF ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR HERE Parliament speaker Nabih Berri, whose party is allied with Hezbollah, on Thursday condemned Israel\\'s use of \"phosphorus bombs\" along Lebanon\\'s border and blamed \"the international community\" for the blazes, alluding to Western military support for Israel. Hama\\'s shock attack saw gunmen pour from Gaza into Israel, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping more than 220, according to Israeli officials. Israel has retaliated with relentless strikes that Gaza\\'s Hamas-run health ministry said have killed more than 7,000, also mainly civilians. Exchanges of fire across the Lebanon-Israel border have since killed at least 57 people in Lebanon, according to an AFP tally, mostly Hezbollah combatants but also four civilians, including Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah. Four people have been killed on the Israeli side, including one civilian. Phosphorus, a substance that catches fire in contact with the air, is used to create smokescreens to hide troop movements, illuminate the battlefield or destroy buildings by fire.

Israel says Hamas is stockpiling fuel for its own use and has called on the militant Palestinian group that governs Gaza to share it. Health services have been crippled by power shortages and hundreds of thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their homes amid the bombing.\\n\\nIsraeli strikes have killed more than 7,028 people in Gaza, including thousands of children, since October 7, according to figures released Thursday by the Hamas-controlled Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.\\n\\nPressure is building on the international community to persuade Israel to allow desperately needed aid into Gaza; the United Nations and several countries in the region have called for an immediate ceasefire, while others advocate for a “humanitarian pause” in fighting.\\n\\nPeople search for survivors and the bodies of victims in the rubble of buildings destroyed during an Israeli bombardment, in Khan Younis in southern Gaza on October 26, 2023.

These conditions are complex because so is the campaign. The troops are ready,” Gallant said in a briefing in Tel Aviv.\\n\\nFor a second night, Israel’s military conducted “targeted raids” in northern Gaza overnight on Friday after vowing to continue ground raids over the coming days.\\n\\nThe raids included aircraft and artillery strikes in the area of Shaja’iyah, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. Video published by the IDF showed tanks and armored vehicles moving on a road near agricultural land as well as strikes on buildings and open areas.\\n\\nThe incursions are intended to kill Hamas militants, lay the foundations for an all-out invasion and neutralize explosive devices and reconnaissance posts, IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said on Thursday.\\n\\nMeanwhile, six people were injured when a rocket struck the Red Sea resort city of Taba, in Egypt, early on Friday, according to official sources cited by Egypt-affiliated Al-Qahera News.\\n\\nThe rocket hit an ambulance building and a residential area of the hospital’s administration in the city, which shares its border with Israel. It is unclear yet who fired the rocket.\\n\\nIDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said at a press briefing Friday that Israel will cooperate with Egypt and the US to “tighten the defense in the region against threats from the Red Sea area.” Hagari said an aerial “threat” had been detected in the Red Sea area, which he said he believed was the cause of the strike in Egypt.\\n\\nA Palestinian man injured in an Israeli airstrike is carried on a stretcher at Nasser Medical Hospital, in Khan Younis, Gaza, on October 27, 2023.

Fatima Shbair/AP In pictures: The deadly clashes in Israel and Gaza Prev Next\\n\\nList of Gazans killed\\n\\nThe health ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza on Thursday published a 212-page report listing thousands of names described as “documented deaths since October 7” in Gaza which it blamed on Israeli military “aggression.”\\n\\nThe ministry said the death toll is likely to be much higher and said its report excludes casualties who have not been identified, those buried without being brought to hospital for registration, or those still missing – who number around 1,600.\\n\\nThe list, which does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants but which does list age, sex and the victim’s ID card number, followed US President Joe Biden’s comments that he had “no confidence” in the figures of civilian casualties reported by the Gaza Health Ministry.\\n\\nIsrael, along with the US, has expressed doubts about the casualty numbers being reported out of Gaza, but has not provided evidence that they are exaggerated.\\n\\nWhite House spokesman John Kirby called the Gaza-based ministry “a front for Hamas,” though when asked he did not dispute that thousands of Palestinians, many innocent civilians, had been killed.\\n\\nThe prime minister of the US-backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, Mohammad Shtayyeh, said the PA’s own health authority considers the numbers to be “correct.”\\n\\nVideo Ad Feedback Surgeon slams Biden\\'s comment on Palestinian death toll 02:45 - Source: CNN\\n\\n“They are our numbers,” Shtayyeh said in an interview Thursday with Al Jazeera. “These numbers are fed to us from the hospitals of Gaza every single day (and) are received by our Ministry of Health.”\\n\\nThe Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority is run by a rival faction to Hamas, and operates the umbrella Ministry of Health which maintains a relationship with the ministry in Gaza. Death tolls for Gaza are released both in Gaza and Ramallah daily.\\n\\nCNN is not able to independently verify the death toll tabulated in Gaza.\\n\\nUN agency ‘paralyzed’ by lack of fuel\\n\\nIsrael has also accused Hamas of controlling life-saving fuel supplies in Gaza, as basic services such as hospitals, bakeries and UN humanitarian operations are on the verge of shutting down due to a lack of fuel.\\n\\nJuliette Touma, the communications director for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), said the agency will be forced to halt operations altogether if it does not get enough fuel – crucial for generating power for hospitals and desalinating water.\\n\\n“UNRWA continues to struggle with very limited and dwindling fuel supplies,” Touma said. “Rationing of deliveries continues, including to medical facilities and bakeries. UNRWA is being paralyzed due to the lack of fuel deliveries into the Gaza Strip.”\\n\\nThe IDF said that the problem is not a lack of fuel in Gaza, but that it is in the hands of Hamas.\\n\\nIDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told CNN on Thursday that Hamas controls “between 800,000 and perhaps more than one million liters of fuel of different types stored inside Gaza,” according to Israeli military intelligence estimates.\\n\\n“Some of it was stockpiled before, some of it stolen from the UN, some of it’s stolen by Hamas from private vendors,” he said.\\n\\nCNN cannot independently verify the amount of fuel in Gaza.\\n\\nIsrael continues to block deliveries of fuel altogether to Gaza, saying that Hamas would only divert it for military use.\\n\\nSpeaking to CNN on Thursday, another UNRWA spokesperson, Tamara Alrifai, said, “Whether or not other sources of fuel exist in Gaza is of no direct relevance to us, we are a human agency and we should not be begging for fuel to nourish our own operations.”\\n\\nWith fuel rapidly running out, UNWRA is being forced to make difficult decisions over diverting power between bakeries and hospital wards with more than 600,000 people now displaced and relying on a single piece of bread each day, Alrifai added.\\n\\nTwelve aid trucks carrying water, food, medicine and medical supplies – but no fuel – entered Gaza from the Rafah border crossing with Egypt on Thursday, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS).\\n\\nA total of 74 trucks have entered the strip since humanitarian aid transfers resumed several days ago, PRCS said.\\n\\nIn normal times, the figure would be about 455 per day, the United Nations has said, meaning basic supplies are trickling into the enclave at a much slower pace than needed.\\n\\nThe head of UNRWA warned the current aid provisions to Gaza were just for “show” and “nothing more than crumbs,” as he warned that hunger and disease were becoming major issues in the besieged enclave.\\n\\n“Over the last week, I followed closely the focus about the number of trucks entering Gaza. Many of us saw in these trucks a glimmer of hope. This is, however, becoming a distraction,” Philippe Lazzarini said at a press conference in Jerusalem on Friday.\\n\\n“We should avoid conveying the message that few trucks a day means the siege is lifted for humanitarian aid. This is not true,” Lazzarini added. “The current system in place is geared to fail. What is needed is meaningful and non-interrupted aid flow.”\\n\\nOvercrowded hospitals on the brink of collapse say they are overwhelmed with the numbers of injured people and doctors have repeatedly told CNN they don’t have the supplies or the electricity to run critical functions to properly care for them.\\n\\nThis story is developing and is being updated.',\n",

She revealed receiving death threats and shared her deep concern over the issue.\\n\\nUpdated Oct 27, 2023 | 03:25 PM IST\\n\\nHere\\'s what Bella Hadid said about Israel-Hamas war (Credit: Instagram)\\n\\nProminent model Bella Hadid, hailing from Palestine, has broken her silence on the Israel-Hamas conflict, offering a heartfelt and impassioned stance on the matter. The model extended an apology for her prior reticence on the topic, acknowledging the gravity and importance of the situation.\\n\\nHere\\'s what Bella Hadid said about the Israel-Hamas war:\\n\\nBella Hadid, renowned for her Palestinian roots, made a significant foray into the Israel-Hamas conflict discussion, providing a unique perspective. Bella shed light on the protracted suffering endured by innocent lives and families throughout the decades-long conflict, underscoring the human toll. She wrote, “I have yet to find the ideal words for this deeply intricate and horrific past 2 weeks, weeks that have turned the world’s attention back towards a situation that has been taking innocent lives and affecting families for decades. I have much to say, but for today, I will keep it short.”\\n\\nIn a startling revelation, she unveiled that her involvement in the conflict discourse had subjected her to daily death threats, escalating concerns for her family\\'s safety. Hadid unequivocally condemned the indiscriminate terrorist attacks on civilians, with a particular focus on safeguarding the well-being of women and children. The model expressed her unwavering support for the \"Free Palestine\" movement while challenging ingrained stereotypes that often misrepresent Palestinians.\\n\\nShe also added, \"I\\'ve been sent hundreds of death threats daily, my phone number has been leaked, and my family has felt to be in danger. But I can not be silenced any longer. Fear is not an option. The people and children of Palestine, especially in Gaza, cannot afford our silence. We are not brave - they are. My heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood.\"\\n\\nSharing her family\\'s narrative, Hadid recounted their history as refugees, compelled to abandon their homes due to settler invasions and violence, illuminating the personal connection she holds to the conflict. Bella issued a compelling call for immediate action to address the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, urging enhanced access to clean water, a stable power supply for hospitals, and improved medical care.\\n\\nShe implored the international community to take substantive measures to alleviate the suffering inflicted by the Israel-Hamas conflict, emphasizing the urgency of the situation and the importance of lasting peace and humanitarian relief.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': \"Israeli officials railed at UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres Tuesday after he appeared to suggest the impetus for the Hamas terror group’s devastating October 7 attack on Israel was the Jewish state’s continued control of Palestinian territories, with the Israeli Ambassador to the UN demanding that he resign.\\n\\n“It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum,” Guterres said at a UN Security Council meeting on the Israel-Hamas war, which erupted when the terror group ravaged Israeli border communities, killing some 1,400 people, the vast majority of them civilians.\\n\\n“The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing,” Guterres said.\\n\\nIsrael evacuated all settlements and military forces from the Gaza Strip under the 2005 Disengagement. It has maintained a tight blockade of the territory since Hamas took control in 2007, as has Egypt, with Jerusalem saying it must do so to limit the terror group’s ability to arm itself for attacks. In the West Bank, settlements have expanded under consecutive governments with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly arguing the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority is not a partner for peace, having rejected several offers in the past.\\n\\nGuterres added that “the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people,” an apparent reference to Israel’s ongoing campaign of airstrikes in the Gaza Strip that Hamas officials say has killed thousands.\\n\\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms\\n\\nIsrael was outraged by Guterres’s comments. UN envoy Gilad Erdan called them “shocking,” and demanded that the secretary general resign. Foreign Minister Eli Cohen canceled a meeting with Guterres, and Minister Benny Gantz labeled the UN chief a “terror apologist.”\\n\\n“The UN Secretary-General, who shows understanding for the campaign of mass murder of children, women, and the elderly, is not fit to lead the UN. I call on him to resign immediately,” Erdan posted on X. “There is no justification or point in talking to those who show compassion for the most terrible atrocities committed against the citizens of Israel and the Jewish people. There are simply no words.”\\n\\nThe @UN Secretary-General, who shows understanding for the campaign of mass murder of children, women, and the elderly, is not fit to lead the UN. Advertisement I call on him to resign immediately. There is no justification or point in talking to those who show compassion for the most… — Ambassador Gilad Erdan גלעד ארדן (@giladerdan1) October 24, 2023\\n\\nErdan said the remarks were “horrible,” and “completely disconnected from the reality in our region.”\\n\\n“It’s sad that a person with such views is the head of an organization that arose after the Holocaust,” he said. “It’s really unfathomable.”\\n\\nForeign Minister Cohen, who had traveled to New York to take part in the meetings on the war, posted to X (formerly Twitter) that he was canceling a planned meeting with Guterres. After what happened on October 7, he wrote, “there is no place for an even-handed approach. Hamas needs to be wiped off the face of the earth.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGantz, who recently joined the government as a member of the narrow war cabinet overseeing the war effort, also had harsh words, posting to X: “Dark are the days when the United Nations Secretary-General condones terror.”\\n\\n“Absolutely nothing can justify the slaughter of innocent civilians,” he wrote. “Now is the time to stand on the right side of history, or be judged by it. Terror apologists cannot speak on behalf of the world.”\\n\\nOn October 7, Hamas abruptly bombarded Israel with thousands of rockets while over 2,500 gunmen breached the border with the Gaza Strip. The terrorists rampaged murderously through southern areas slaughtering those they found, butchering entire families in some communities and also killing 260 at an outdoor music festival. Some victims were mutilated, raped, and tortured. Dozens of babies were killed. Before the IDF could counter the invasion, over 220 people of all ages were abducted and dragged back to Gaza as captives. Four have since been released.\\n\\nIsrael has responded to the Hamas assault by vowing to destroy the terror group and launching intensive strikes in Gaza, saying it is hitting terror targets while trying to avoid civilian casualties. It has told over one million Gaza residents to evacuate the northern part of the Strip ahead of an expected ground incursion.\\n\\nThe Hamas-controlled Health Ministry says the strikes have killed over 5,700 Palestinians so far. Those numbers cannot be independently verified and are believed to include Hamas’s own members, as well as civilians killed by misfired Palestinian rockets.\\n\\nThe Security Council session brought together top diplomats including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has previously rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying it would only allow Hamas to regroup.\\n\\nGuterres said he was “deeply concerned about the clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza. Let me be clear: No party to an armed conflict is above international humanitarian law.”\\n\\n“The relentless bombardment of Gaza by Israeli forces, the level of civilian casualties, and the wholesale destruction of neighborhoods continue to mount and are deeply alarming,” he said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNoting that he had previously “condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented… acts of terror by Hamas,” Guterres called for all the hostages to be treated humanely and “released immediately and without conditions.”\\n\\nAlong with its military campaign, Israel has also imposed a near-total blockade of Gaza, though some humanitarian aid has been permitted to enter from Egypt in recent days under a US-brokered deal.\\n\\n“But [that] is a drop of aid in an ocean of need,” Guterres said and cautioned that if Gaza runs out of fuel it will be a “disaster.”\\n\\nHe warned the conflict “risks spiraling throughout the region” and appealed for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire” while urging an eventual two-state solution that would see a Palestinian state created alongside Israel.\\n\\nCohen, the foreign minister, also attended the Security Council meeting, bringing with him family members of some of those held captive in Gaza.\\n\\nAddressing the forum, he warned that if the UN does not back the drive to eradicate Hamas, it will face its “darkest hour” on Guterres’s watch.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the UN on Tuesday called for improved coordination among humanitarian groups to make sure the small amount of aid now moving into the Strip contained only the most needed items.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nUNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said that some of the food delivered into Gaza so far, such as rice and lentils, had been impractical given the dwindling availability of fresh water and fuel.\\n\\n“An additional challenge in a very limited flow of supplies is that we are not really receiving the most needed supplies for Gaza, or the most relevant,” UNRWA spokeswoman Tamara Alrifai said.\\n\\n“In one of the shipments over the last couple of days, we received boxes of rice and lentils,” she told journalists at the UN in Geneva via video link from the Jordanian capital Amman, where UNRWA has its headquarters.\\n\\n“But for people to cook lentils and rice, they need water and gas. And therefore these kinds of supplies — while very generous and well-intended — are not very usable right now,” she said.\\n\\nAlrifai added that before October 7, around 500 trucks a day were entering Gaza from Israel and Egypt, with a mixture of commercial goods, food, aid and fuel.\\n\\nBut only a few dozen trucks carrying food, medicine, and water have entered Gaza via the southern border with Egypt since a deal entered into effect on Saturday.\\n\\n“We will need to get better as a consortium of humanitarians in sending very explicit lists of what is most needed,” Alrifai said.\\n\\nFuel concerns\\n\\nThe UN has warned that more hospitals and other vital services in the Palestinian territory risked shutting down without fuel deliveries.\\n\\nIsrael worries that Hamas would use fuel brought into Gaza to manufacture weapons and explosives. The IDF also said Tuesday that Hamas is holding at least half a million liters of fuel for its military purposes, withholding it from hospitals.\\n\\nAlrifai said fuel crossings into Gaza could be logistically handled by UNRWA, which was obliged to report any misuse.\\n\\n“When we at UNRWA receive fuel or any other equipment, we are accountable for its handling. A couple of close donors, close countries did raise the security question… we are obligated to report to them any misuse that we see, or any risk,” she said.\\n\\nAlrifai said UNRWA had in place a “very sturdy diligence system to make sure that everything we receive is only used for humanitarian purposes.”\\n\\nIsrael has often accused UNRWA of failing to report Hamas misdeeds, essentially enabling the terror group to operate freely within Gaza’s civilian population.\\n\\nMedical aid\\n\\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it had been unable to distribute any life-saving health supplies from the truck convoys to major hospitals in northern Gaza, because of a lack of security guarantees.\\n\\nIt said the main Al-Shifa hospital in the north now had three patients for every two beds.\\n\\n“In addition to the hospitals that have had to close due to damage and attacks, six hospitals across the Gaza Strip have already shut down due to lack of fuel,” the WHO said in a statement.\\n\\nMedical supplies have been delivered to four hospitals in southern Gaza and medics “took boxes of supplies off the trucks and straight into operating theaters, where doctors have been performing surgeries without anesthesia or other basic surgical supplies,” the agency said.\",\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Shortly after midnight on October 8, Mohammed Zubair, a fact-checking journalist based in Bangalore, came across a video on Twitter. Less than a day had elapsed since the Hamas attacks in Israel, but the caption on the post claimed that Palestinians had shot down four Israeli helicopters in Gaza. Zubair had seen similar footage dozens of times before—from the simulation video game Arma 3, passed off as visuals from the Ukraine war.\\n\\nZubair lives in close quarters with his parents, wife, and children; his only time for solitary concentration is when his kids are asleep. As part of his daily work routine, he scours the internet for fake news and propaganda for an hour after midnight. To him, October 8 felt different: The deluge of disinformation he spotted on Indian social media left him stunned. “The scale of misinformation this time was horrific and unimaginable,” Zubair told me.\\n\\nA grim video of a beheading by a Mexican drug cartel was shared as an attack on Israeli citizens. A nine-year-old photograph of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his son, taken before the latter departed for his military service, was portrayed as the leader sending his offspring to war. Footage of a funeral staged in Jordan to evade a pandemic lockdown was misrepresented as Palestinians faking deaths in Gaza. A 2014 video of the Islamic State destroying a mosque in Syria was labeled as the Israeli bombing of a Palestinian mosque.\\n\\nRead: The war in Gaza is getting remixed in real time\\n\\nFor the next few nights, Zubair found himself staying up until well after dawn, debunking the cascade of disinformation through his Twitter account, which has close to 1 million followers. According to him, roughly two-thirds of the disinformation about the conflict was coming from the Hindu right, which is one of the most formidable purveyors of propaganda in the world. Dispensing with complexity and real-world consequences, the disinformation machinery of the Hindu right has been operating in an amoral zone, treating the Israel-Hamas war as little more than an entertaining spectacle happening somewhere far away, and as a windfall for its Islamophobic agenda.\\n\\nThe Hindu-nationalist movement has for decades complained of alienation from India’s largely liberal press, where, it claimed, its ideological vision was given short shrift. With the advent of social-media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, and messaging applications such as WhatsApp, the Hindu right had the tools to undercut the mainstream press and eventually overwhelm it.\\n\\nThe Hindu right’s communications machinery is extensive and organized. A digital army numbering in the tens of thousands imprints the movement’s desired narrative on India’s public, regardless of the facts. In 2018, while addressing the Bharatiya Janata Party’s social-media conclave, Amit Shah, then the president of the party and the country’s home minister since 2019, boasted, “We could make any message go viral, whether sweet or sour, real or fake.”\\n\\nZubair told me that the party’s famed information-technology cell was undergirded by a much larger unofficial trolling universe. The party taps low-paid techies with Hindu-nationalist sympathies to spread its message, for example. “For them, it’s additional pocket money to communicate ideological convictions they already share,” he said.\\n\\nIn 2017, Zubair, along with Pratik Sinha, founded Alt News, an independent website dedicated to combatting disinformation in India. Zubair and Sinha had both trained as engineers, and they shared an obsession with the seemingly uncontrollable epidemic of fake news in the country. What began as a three-person enterprise now has close to 20 employees and bureaus in two Indian cities.\\n\\nAs the website’s influence has grown, Alt News has attracted the ire of the Hindu right. In the summer of 2022, Zubair was imprisoned for more than three weeks on a government charge that a satirical tweet he’d posted several years prior had hurt Hindu sentiments. Sinha, who has been a strident critic of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his role in the 2002 violence in the western state of Gujarat, left the province fearing for his personal safety. The group has nevertheless carried on with work that has become perilous in India; according to Time magazine, Zubair and Sinha were among the favorites to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022.\\n\\nSince the Hamas attacks, Hindu nationalists across India have held rallies in support of Israel, while in states governed by the Hindu right, pro-Palestine demonstrators have been arrested. The pattern is a striking anomaly for a country historically sympathetic to the Arab nation’s cause. In the Hindu-nationalist imagination, Israel and India occupy parallel positions—surrounded by Muslim enemies within and without. And the Hindu right approves of a country it perceives as a hard, militaristic, technologically advanced power that is ruthless in dealing with its Muslim foes.\\n\\nThe movement’s identification with Israel is, in many ways, perverse. Hindu nationalism took root in the 1920s, inspired by the rise of European fascism. In 1931, B. S. Moonje, the president of the Hindu Mahasabha, was deeply impressed by Benito Mussolini, whom he met on a visit to Italy. M. S. Golwalkar, the chief ideologue of the Hindu right, thought the “Final Solution” was a good lesson for Indians “to learn and profit by.”\\n\\nThe timelines of India and Israel track closely with each other: India gained freedom from British colonial rule in 1947, and the creation of Israel came a year later. Both countries were gripped with anxiety upon their founding, as civil conflicts raged in the background. But India and Israel were estranged for more than four decades; formal diplomatic relations would not be established until 1992.\\n\\nAs the largest nation to have shaken off colonialism, India saw itself as the leader of the postcolonial world. Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first and longest-serving prime minister, viewed the Palestinian cause through the prism of that wider anticolonial struggle. India had little history of anti-Semitism: A smattering of tiny Jewish communities had prospered in the country for centuries without facing any form of persecution.\\n\\nIn the decades following its independence, India remained militantly allied to the Palestinian cause. In 1975, India became the first non-Arab country to grant the Palestine Liberation Organization full diplomatic status. In 1983, Yasser Arafat, the charismatic leader of the PLO, received a rapturous reception during a visit to New Delhi.\\n\\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought an era of free-market economics to India and a warming of its relationship with the United States. This shift in orientation set the conditions for India and Israel to establish diplomatic ties in 1992. Since then, the two countries have moved closer. “Over the years, we have seen a shift from India being pro-Palestine to more pro-Israel today,” Suhasini Haidar, the diplomatic-affairs editor of The Hindu newspaper, told me. “The relationship has been on an upswing.” More and more Indian Jews have been exercising the right to return; direct flights to Tel Aviv began in 2018.\\n\\nLast year, India joined a Middle East partnership, comprising Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States, that pledged to address shared environmental and economic goals while reaffirming support for the Abraham Accords and other normalization arrangements with Israel. (The move led to a significant worsening of the country’s long-friendly relationship with Iran.) Defense ties are central to the entente between India and Israel. India is, by some distance, the largest buyer of arms from Israel; the country is seen as a dependable source of high-grade military technology. During the 1999 Kargil War—India’s brief conflict with archenemy Pakistan—Israel came to New Delhi’s rescue with immediate military assistance. (Israel has no diplomatic relations with Pakistan.)\\n\\nOver the past decade, a close personal relationship between Netanyahu and Modi, both right-wing populists embodying a muscular nationalism, has strengthened the ties between the two nations. Haidar covered Modi’s first state visit to Israel in 2017. “It was a five-day lovefest,” she told me. “Netanyahu greeted Modi at the airport. They spent every waking moment together.”\\n\\nModi has borrowed from Netanyahu’s bold national-security doctrine. In 2019, a suicide bomber attacked an Indian paramilitary convoy, killing 44 people. Modi responded by striking deep into Pakistani territory. Later that year, during a national election in Israel, Netanyahu sought to buttress his foreign-policy credentials by putting up giant banners flaunting his relationship with Modi, an honor previously reserved for American presidents.\\n\\n“Israel knows that the Hindu right glorified Hitler,” Haidar told me. “Both sides try to ignore that.”\\n\\nHindu nationalists have sought to use the October 7 attack on Israel to further their own domestic ideological ends. They point to the violence in Israel to emphasize the menace of Islamic terrorism, a theme they believe will play in their favor in national elections next year. The subject has proved politically beneficial for Modi in the past: The 2019 military strike against Pakistan, undertaken on the eve of the last election, transformed a sputtering campaign.\\n\\nRead: Violence is the engine of Modi’s politics\\n\\nNow the Hindu right’s media actors, from national news anchors to itinerant social-media trolls, are playing their domestic political games in a volatile global context. To an inflamed and polarized conflict in the Middle East, the Hindu-right media ecosystem contributes mislabeled videos and fake stories, further muddying the distinctions between true events and motivated falsehoods.\\n\\nNot surprisingly under these circumstances, the claims that Hindu nationalists put forward are getting taken up by interested actors in other countries. Zubair, who spars online with the Hindu right all the time, now finds himself battling far-right influencers in Israel and the United States who peddle false information originating in India. Five days after the Hamas attacks, Sinha, Zubair’s Alt News co-founder, reflected on Twitter, “Hopefully the world will now realise how the Indian right-wing has made India the disinformation capital of the world.”',\n",

The invasion, he said, is contingent on IDF’s “operational superiority” and the government’s decision to go ahead.\\n\\n• It’s been more than two weeks since the October 7 attacks, the Israeli air forces have conducted air strikes in Gaza. What’s the objective?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• There have been concerns on civilians being killed in Gaza.

The UNRWA provides services in eight refugee camps across Gaza.\\n\\n“The Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated areas in the world at 5,900 residents per square kilometre,” according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Some 41% of the population in Gaza are under the age of 15.\\n\\nOver 1.4 million Gazans have been internally displaced since Hamas’ attacks on Israel earlier this month, the UN’s humanitarian coordination office said Friday. Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the EU, US and several other nations.\\n\\nAccording to Hamas officials, more than 4,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the conflict.\\n\\nThe Gaza Strip has 13 hospitals, which are “only partially operational due to supply shortages and fuel rationing,” according to OCHA.\\n\\nA press release by Fabrizio Carboni, regional director for the Near and Middle East for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), warns that, “Gaza loses power, hospitals lose power, putting newborns in incubators and elderly patients on oxygen at risk. Kidney dialysis stops, and X-rays can’t be taken. Without electricity, hospitals risk turning into morgues.”\\n\\nThe Gaza Strip has one power plant, generating about 70 megawatts of electricity per day. This covers a small fraction of the territory’s total energy needs of at least 400 megawatts, according to data collated by the OCHA. In addition, some 120 megawatts of power are ordinarily imported from Israel. On average, Gazans have received an average of 13 hours electricity per day this year.\\n\\nFollowing Hamas’ assault, Israel stopped supplying electricity to the Gaza Strip. With Gaza’s only power plant now out of fuel and offline, the territory is without electricity, meaning residents and institutions alike are dependent on power generators.\\n\\nGaza’s unemployment rate stands at over 45%, according to OCHA data. Some 60% of people aged 15-29 are without work.\\n\\nData gathered by the UN body shows that in 2021, over 80% of Gazans employed in the private sector earned less than the minimum wage of $442 (€419) per month.\\n\\nUNICEF spokesman Stephane Dujarric has said that nearly 80% of Gazans rely on humanitarian assistance.\\n\\nIsrael imposed a land, sea and air blockade of the Gaza Strip in 2007, after Hamas took control of the territory. Since then, people’s movements into and out of the area through Israeli checkpoints and the sole crossing into Egypt at Rafah have been severely restricted, says the UNRWA.\\n\\nFollowing Hamas’ October 7 terror assault, Israel imposed a “total blockade,” shuttering all checkpoints and halting the delivery of food, aid, and fuel into the Gaza Strip.\\n\\nThis means the Rafah crossing to Egypt — the only checkpoint not controlled by Israel — is the sole route for food, aid and other items into Gaza. In the past, the Rafah crossing has been shut for extended periods and only open on an irregular basis.\\n\\n• Why the US is supporting Israel?\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍Israel mounts limited ground raids in Gaza, air strikes on\\n\\nTHE CITY\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhat are dust suppressants & have they worked in the past?\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: General issues on Environmental ecology, Bio-diversity and Climate Change\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMains Examination: General Studies III: Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation, environmental impact assessment.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story- Dust suppressants will be used in Delhi to mitigate pollution from dust. This, however, is not the first time it has been used in the Capital and parts of NCR. Dust suppressants may be salts of calcium or magnesium that can absorb moisture. Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the “dust suppressant powder” would be mixed along with water and sprayed on roads to keep the dust down for longer.\\n\\nIn 2019, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) told the NCR states that they may consider using dust suppressants on excavated earth surfaces, piles of construction and demolition waste, and access roads in construction areas.\\n\\n• What are the Dust suppressants?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• Do You Know-An advisory issued by the Delhi PWD in 2019 also noted that the “use of dust suppressants in water can be more effective than plain water sprinkling as it shows more efficiency to reduce particulate matter emission”. The advisory, which mentioned “magnesium chloride hexahydrate flakes,” added that the dust suppressant with bio-additives helps to reduce dust for five to six hours as compared to plain water which lasts for 15 to 30 minutes. Magnesium chloride absorbs moisture.\\n\\nIn 2019, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee had also issued directions that all construction agencies will use dust suppressants to control dust emissions and road-owning agencies will use it on dusty patches.\\n\\n• What Delhi is doing to fight pollution?\\n\\n• Fine particulate matter (PM 10 and PM2.5)-What is this and how does it get into the air?\\n\\n• What are the sources of particulate matter PM 10 and PM2.5?\\n\\n• What are the Harmful Effects of particulate matter PM 10 and PM2.5?\\n\\n• What are the various Supreme Courts Judgments on Air Pollutions?\\n\\n• Know about 2021 WHO air quality guidelines\\n\\n• What was the Supreme court’s verdict in M.

The Act replaced The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, and seeks to widen its scope in addressing consumer concerns. The new Act recognises offences such as providing false information regarding the quality or quantity of a good or service, and misleading advertisements. It also specifies action to be taken if goods and services are found “dangerous, hazardous or unsafe”.\\n\\nThe CCPA, introduced in the new Act, aims to protect the rights of the consumer by cracking down on unfair trade practices, and false and misleading advertisements that are detrimental to the interests of the public and consumers.\\n\\nThe CCPA will have the powers to inquire or investigate into matters relating to violations of consumer rights or unfair trade practices suo motu, or on a complaint received, or on a direction from the central government.\\n\\n• What do you understand by “misleading advertisement”?\\n\\n• Do You Know-The Section 2(28) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 defines “misleading advertisement” in relation to any product or service which— (i) falsely describes such product or service; or (ii) gives a false guarantee to, or is likely to mislead the consumers as to the nature, substance, quantity or quality of such product or service; or (iii) conveys an implied representation which, if made by the manufacturer or seller or service provider thereof, would constitute an unfair trade practice; or (iv) deliberately conceals important information.\\n\\nBriefing reporters, CCPA Chief Commissioner Nidhi Khare said IAS coaching institutes lure civil services aspirants by resorting to “misleading and exaggerated” claims. Taking cognizance of such advertisements, the CCPA has issued notices against them for violation of provisions of Section 2(28) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, Khare said. Citing examples of misleading claims made by one of the coaching institutes, Khare said the institute claimed credit for 682 of 933 selected candidates in the UPSC examination in 2022. However, when the CCPA sent notice to the coaching institute, it clarified that of the 682 candidates, 673 took mock interviews at its institute and 9 aspirants enrolled in courses like test series and general studies, the official said, adding that the coaching institute did not specify that the majority of successful candidates availed only mock interviews and tests.\\n\\nThe senior official said the current market revenue of the coaching industry in the country is Rs 58,088 crore. Approximately, over 2 lakh students move to Kota annually, she said.\\n\\n• How Central Consumer Protection Authority deals with false or misleading advertisements?\\n\\n• Do You Know-Section 21 of the new Act defines the powers given to the CCPA to crack down on false or misleading advertisements. According to these provisions, if the CCPA is satisfied after investigation that any advertisement is false or misleading and is harmful to the interest of any consumer, or is in contravention of consumer rights, the CCPA may issue directions to the trader, manufacturer, endorser, advertiser, or publisher to discontinue such an advertisement, or modify it in a manner specified by the authority, within a given time. The authority may also impose a penalty up to Rs 10 lakh, with imprisonment up to two years, on the manufacturer or endorser of false and misleading advertisements. The penalty may go up to Rs 50 lakh, with imprisonment up to five years, for every subsequent offence committed by the same manufacturer or endorser.\\n\\nCCPA may ban the endorser of a false or misleading advertisement from making endorsement of any products or services in the future, for a period that may extend to one year. The ban may extend up to three years in every subsequent violation of the Act.\\n\\n• What are the other powers vested with CCPA?\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍Misleading ads: Comply with rules or will refer violators to CCPA for action, says Govt\\n\\nTHE EDITORIAL PAGE\\n\\nVienna gives Delhi the right\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance.\\n\\nMains Examination: General Studies II: Bilateral, regional and global groupings and agreements involving India and/or affecting India’s interests.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story- Prabhash Ranjan Writes: The bilateral relations between India and Canada, already reeling from allegations about the former’s involvement in the killing of a Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil, have nosedived further. Canada’s latest accusation is that India has unilaterally revoked the diplomatic immunity of Canadian diplomats based in India, thus violating international law.\\n\\n• What is Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations?\\n\\n• ‘India is in violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (VCDR), according to Canada’-Comment\\n\\n• For Your Information-Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (VCDR) — an international treaty that provides the framework for the conduct of diplomatic relations between independent countries. VCDR strives to balance the interests and imperatives of receiving states (the host country where a diplomatic mission is based) and sending states (the country that sends the diplomatic mission to another country).\\n\\nCanada’s charge is very serious, but not borne out by the facts. India did not revoke the immunity of Canadian diplomats. It asked Canada to cut down the size of its mission by taking back several diplomats based on the principle of parity. India’s demand was communicated to Canada through regular diplomatic channels, and Ottawa was given adequate time to perform this task. At the most, it can be argued that had these diplomats continued to stay in India, they would have lost their diplomatic immunities. But this would be a logical outcome of the sending state (Canada) not taking back these diplomats despite the receiving state’s (India) demand. This is different from Canada’s charge that India has revoked diplomatic immunities. India didn’t declare any of these diplomats persona non grata (unacceptable person). However, as the receiving state, India has the right to do so under Article 9 of VCDR without explaining its decision to the sending state (Canada).\\n\\n• Does India has the right to ask Canada, or any country, to cut down the size of its mission operating on Indian soil?\\n\\n• How did India’s relationship with Canada fare historically?\\n\\n• India-Canada bilateral relations-know in detail\\n\\n• How have India-Canada relations deteriorated in recent months?\\n\\n• Why recent allegations by Canada are troubling and unprecedented?\\n\\n• For Your Information-Canada-India relations have see-sawed over the last 50 years. During the Cold War, bonhomie developed between Ottawa and New Delhi due to their shared commonwealth status and convergent views on the importance of the United Nations, multilateralism, and advancing global development. Differences over Cold War crises in Korea, Hungary, and Vietnam strained the relationship. India’s nuclear programme tested ties further. In the 1980s, Ottawa’s interest in India was rekindled by rising Indian immigration. With limited prospects for trade or security relations, there was no basis for meaningful diplomatic engagement. Since then, however, much work has gone into reviving the relationship from its nadir in 1998, following Ottawa’s repudiation of India’s nuclear power status. Investment and trade form the heart of the relationship now, with considerable scope for growth. These issues and the bilateral relationship are held hostage by specific diaspora elements that harbour a deep hatred toward India, abhor its territorial unity and strive to Balkanise it.\\n\\n• “Anti-India activities” and “politically-condoned hate crimes” are some of the harsh terms that India has used to describe situation in Canada—What has caused India to take such a decisive step?\\n\\n• By calling it “politically-condoned hate crimes and criminal violence”, Delhi is targeting the Trudeau government-Why?\\n\\n• Canada hosts one of the largest Indian diasporas in the world-Can you tell little more on this?\\n\\n• For Your Information- Canada hosts one of the largest Indian diasporas in the world, numbering 16 lakh people of Indian origin, accounting for more than 3 percent of the total Canadian population and 700,000 NRIs. India became the top source of foreign students studying in Canada — 2.3 lakh, according to 2022 data. India’s total trade with Canada (goods and services) in 2021-22 was US $11.68 billion, much below potential, but when it comes to India’s import of pulses, almost 30% of the total import comes from Canada.\\n\\nCanadian pension funds have cumulatively invested around US $55 billion in India. Cumulative FDI from Canada since 2000 is about US$4.07 billion.\\n\\nAll these have continued despite speed bumps like the recent pause in trade talks — and despite challenges over the Khalistan issue.\\n\\nAs per the 2021 Canadian census, Sikhs account for 2.1 per cent of Canada’s population, and are the country’s fastest growing religious group. After India, Canada is home to the largest population of Sikhs in the world. Today, Sikhs lawmakers and officials serve at all levels of Canada’s government, and their burgeoning population is one of the most important political constituencies in the country. In 2017, Jagmeet Singh, 39, became the first Sikh leader of a major Canadian political party when he took the reins of the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP).\\n\\n• What do you understand by the word “diaspora”?\\n\\n• Sikh Diaspora in Canada and India-Know in detail\\n\\n• Ottawa’s, particularly this government’s, confounding deference to Khalistani groups and other diaspora elements has characterised its foreign policy-Why Canada is a breeding ground for Khalistan elements?\\n\\n• ‘This is not the first time that Khalistan has figured in an India-Canada context-Why Pro-Khalistan elements are still there in Canada?\\n\\n• Canada has for long been considered a safe haven for Khalistan supporters and militant voices accused of terrorism in India-Why so?\\n\\n• Why do Canadian politicians pander to Sikh extremists?\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍US, Australia lend support to Canada call for India’s cooperation in probe\\n\\n📍Canada needs to see India – not just the diaspora\\n\\nEXPLAINED\\n\\nThe uneven spread of medical colleges, debate over regulator’s new guidelines\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Economic and Social Development-Sustainable Development, Poverty, Inclusion, Demographics, Social Sector Initiatives, etc.\\n\\nMain Examination:\\n\\n• General Studies II: Functions and responsibilities of the Union and the States, issues and challenges pertaining to the federal structure, devolution of powers and finances up to local levels and challenges therein.\\n\\n• General Studies II: Issues relating to development and management of Social Sector/Services relating to Health, Education, Human Resources.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story- Nagaland got its first medical college earlier this month — the Nagaland Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (NIMSR) at Phriebagei in Kohima will have 100 MBBS seats for the coming academic session next year.\\n\\nThe government has been emphasising on an equal distribution of medical colleges across the country, and a new regulation issued by the medical education regulator National Medical Commission (NMC) in August put a hold on new medical colleges and expansion of existing colleges in states with more than 100 medical education seats per million population.\\n\\n• How are medical college seats currently distributed among states?\\n\\n• Will states with an excess of medical college seats have to start shutting colleges or cutting seats?\\n\\n• Why National Medical Commission (NMC) is restricting the opening of new medical colleges in many states?\\n\\n• So is there merit in the NMC’s argument?\\n\\n• What is ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population?\\n\\n• What are the new guidelines by National Medical Commission (NMC)?\\n\\n• Do You Know-The National Medical Commission, through its ‘Undergraduate Medical Education Board’ notification has stipulated that “medical colleges shall follow the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that State and Union Territory.”\\n\\n• Recently, Telangana government also inaugurated nine government medical colleges, pushing the State’s total count to 28-Does this breach new guidelines by National Medical Commission?\\n\\n• What is the doctor to population ratio in India\\n\\n• Why National Medical Commission guidelines is another serious encroachment on the powers of the state government and the state legislature?\\n\\n• “In a recent judgement, the Supreme Court also held that executive instructions could not impose reasonable restrictions on the fundamental right to establish educational institutions under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India”-Analyse\\n\\n• What are key issues faced by the healthcare sector of India?\\n\\n• India’s Health Budget-Know the Statistics\\n\\n• How does the pandemic affected health services?\\n\\n• How does the impact of the pandemic on health services put the spotlight on the benefits of digital innovation and technology-enabled solutions?\\n\\n• How implementation of Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) united all stakeholders in the digital healthcare ecosystem?\\n\\n• Public Health Systems in India-Know the Background\\n\\n• Current state of India’s health infrastructure- What World Bank data says?\\n\\n• COVID-19 Pandemic and India’s Healthcare System-Connect the dots\\n\\n• Steps required to strengthen the existing state of Health infrastructure in India\\n\\n• What do you understand by Universal Health Coverage (UHC)?\\n\\n• PM Atma Nirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana and Ayushman Bharat Scheme-Key Highlights\\n\\n• Is there any explicit/implicit recognition of the right to health or healthcare under the Constitution?

Major incidents in the epic are covered in an episodic way, with an interplay between dialogue and musical verses. Performances last days, and culminate on Dussehra with the burning of the effigy of Ravan, representing the victory of good over evil.\\n\\nIn this broad form, Ramleela has travelled to distant corners of the world with the Indian diaspora. Here we look at one such instance — that of Trinidad, an island in the Caribbean with a significant Indian population.\\n\\n• How did Ramleela reach Trinidad?\\n\\n• So, what exactly was Indian indentured labour?\\n\\n• Do You Know-In early 19th century Britain, calls to abolish slavery intensified. Slave trade was banned in 1807, and finally abolished in 1834 in the British Empire. This, however, created a massive problem in many British colonies whose economy depended on slave labour. The island of Trinidad, where sugar formed the backbone of the economy, was one such colony.\\n\\nIn 1838, the enactment of the emancipation legislation in Trinidad was followed by a large-scale emigration of emancipated slaves from the sugar estates. Plantation owners, desperate to keep their economy afloat, turned to indentured labour from India. On May 30, 1845 the very first boatload of indentured Indians came to Trinidad.\\n\\nWhile seen as more human than slavery, indentured servitude was nonetheless brutal for labourers. ‘Agents’ back in India would lure unsuspecting Indians to it with the promise of riches and opportunity. A part of their wages would be withheld till the end of the contract. This way, labourers would effectively be under bondage while working in back breaking conditions on the plantations.\\n\\n“Use of indentured labour from colonies like India … unfolds a story of uneven power relations, between labour in the colonies and capital in the ruling country under State patronage,” economist Sunanda Sen wrote in ‘Indentured Labour from Indian in the Age of Empire’ (2016).\\n\\nToday, Indians — mostly descendents of these labourers who continued to enter Trinidad as late as 1917 — form the largest ethnic group in Trinidad, at around 35 per cent of the total population. Most came from the present day eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.\\n\\n• ‘When travelling to these distant lands, indentured individuals were unable to carry many material possessions. What they did bring, though, was their culture’-Discuss\\n\\n• How did the indentured Labourers maintained their cultural identity in other parts of the world?\\n\\n• How indentured Labour system led to cultural fusion?\\n\\n• Have you heard of Chutney music?\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍Indenture system ended a century ago, but Indians still face racism in British colonies\\n\\n📍In the land of ‘Sri Ram’: Why Indian indentured labourers in Suriname refused to come back\\n\\nPrevious Year UPSC Main Paper Questions covering the same theme:\\n\\n📍Why indentured labour was taken by British from India to other colonies?

Even if their narrative is true, they only destroyed 20% of the tunnels.\"\\n\\nHOSTAGE WITNESS\\n\\nThere has been no corroboration of the comment by Sinwar, who is thought to be hiding underground ahead of an expected Israeli ground offensive.\\n\\nBut the estimate of hundreds of kilometres is widely accepted by security analysts, even though the blockaded coastal strip is only 40km (25 miles) long.\\n\\nWith Israel in full control of Gaza\\'s air and sea access and 59km of its 72km land borders - with Egypt 13km to the south - tunnels provide one of the few ways for Hamas to bring in weapons, equipment and people.\\n\\nWhile it and other Palestinian groups are secretive about their networks, recently released Israeli hostage, 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz, said: \"It looked like a spider\\'s web, many, many tunnels,\" adding: \"We walked kilometres under the ground.\"\\n\\nHamas believes that with Israel\\'s overwhelming aerial and armoured military superiority, tunnels are a way to cut some of those advantages by forcing Israel\\'s soldiers to move underground in cramped spaces the Hamas fighters know well.\\n\\nAn Israeli military spokesperson said on Thursday: \"I won\\'t elaborate on the number of kilometres of tunnels but it is a high number, built under schools and residential areas.\"\\n\\nUrging the United Nations Security Council to intervene, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called for an immediate cessation of \"aggression\" on Gaza and moves toward \"a political solution instead of military and security solutions\".\\n\\nUNDERGROUND CITY\\n\\nIsraeli security sources say Israel\\'s heavy aerial bombardments have caused little damage to the tunnel infrastructure with Hamas naval commandos able to launch a seaborne attack targeting coastal communities near Gaza this week.\\n\\n\"Although we have been attacking massively for days and days, the (Hamas) leadership is pretty much intact, as is the ability to command and control, the ability even to try and launch counter attacks,\" said Amir Avivi, a former brigadier general whose senior positions in the Israeli military included deputy commander of the Gaza division, tasked with tackling tunnels.\\n\\n\"There is a whole city all over Gaza underneath with depths of 40-50 metres. There are bunkers and headquarters and storage and of course they are connected to more than a thousand rocket launching positions.\"\\n\\nOther sources estimated depths of up to 80 metres.\\n\\nOne Western security source said: \"They run for miles. They are made of concrete and very well made. Think of the Viet Cong times 10. They have had years and lots of money with which to work with.\"\\n\\nAnother security source, from one of Israel\\'s neighbouring countries, said Hamas\\'s tunnels from Egypt remain active.\\n\\n\"The supply chain is still intact these days. The network involved in facilitating co-ordination are some Egyptian military officers. It is unclear if there is knowledge of this by the Egyptian army,\" he said.\\n\\nA small number of narrower, deep, smuggling tunnels were still operating until recently between Egypt and Gaza, according to two security sources and a trader in the Egyptian city of El Arish, but they had slowed to a near-halt since the Israel-Hamas war started.\\n\\nEgyptian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Wednesday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said while inspecting military units in Suez that the army\\'s role was to secure Egyptian borders.\\n\\nLONG GAME\\n\\nHamas was created in Gaza in 1987 and is thought to have begun digging tunnels in the mid-1990s, when Israel granted Yasser Arafat\\'s Palestine Liberation Organization some degree of self-rule in Gaza.\\n\\nThe tunnel network is a key reason why Hamas is stronger in Gaza than in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Israel\\'s settlements, military bases and monitoring devices make it harder to get anything in from Jordan.\\n\\nTunneling became easier in 2005 when Israel pulled its soldiers and settlers out of Gaza, and when Hamas won power in a 2006 election.\\n\\nShortly afterwards Hamas\\'s military wing, the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, captured Gilad Shalit and killed two other Israeli soldiers after burrowing 600 metres to raid the Kerem Shalom base on the Gaza border.\\n\\nA year later Hamas launched a military strike against Arafat\\'s forces in Gaza using tunnel-mounted attacks.\\n\\nAlthough the military tunnels remained off-limits to outside eyes, during that era Gaza smugglers would show off their scarcely concealed commercial tunnels under the Rafah border.\\n\\nThese were around three feet (one metre) wide and used winch motors to haul goods along the sandy tunnel floors in hollowed-out petrol barrels.\\n\\nOne Rafah tunnel operator, Abu Qusay, said a half-mile tunnel took three to six months to dig and could yield profits of up to $100,000 a day. The most profitable item was bullets, bought for $1 each in Egypt and fetching more than $6 in Gaza. Kalashnikov rifles, he said, cost $800 in Egypt and sold for twice that.\\n\\nIn 2007 the military wing is thought to have brought its commander Mohammed Deif into Gaza through a tunnel from Egypt. Deif was the mastermind behind Hamas\\'s deadly Oct. 7 attack into Israel, which killed 1,400 people and hostages were taken.\\n\\nTUNNEL HUNTING\\n\\nProfessor Joel Roskin, a geomorphologist and geologist with Israel\\'s Bar-Ilan University said it was difficult to map the tunnel network accurately from the surface or space, adding highly classified information was essential for 3D mapping and imagery visualization.\\n\\nAmong the elite units tasked with going underground is Yahalom, specialist commandos from Israel\\'s Combat Engineering Corps known as the \"weasels\", who specialise in finding, clearing and destroying the tunnels.\\n\\nEarlier this week Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Yahalom fighters, telling them: \"I rely on you, the people of Israel rely on you.\"\\n\\nIsraeli sources said what awaits them is formidable and they faced an enemy that has regrouped and learned from previous Israeli operations in 2014 and 2021.\\n\\n\"There are going to be a lot of booby traps. They have thermobaric weapons that they didn\\'t have in 2021, which are more lethal. And I believe they acquired a lot of anti-tank weapon systems that are going to try to hit our APCs (armoured personnel carriers), tanks,\" said Amnon Sofrin, a former brigadier general and former commander of the Combat Intelligence Corps.\\n\\nSofrin, who was also previously head of the intelligence directorate with Israel\\'s Mossad spy agency, said Hamas would also be trying to kidnap soldiers.\\n\\nDaphne Richemond-Barak, professor at Israel\\'s Reichman University and author of the book Underground Warfare, said the conflicts in Syria and Iraq had changed the situation.\\n\\n\"What the IDF (Israeli military) is likely to face inside the tunnels is also all of the experience and all of the knowledge that has been gained by groups like ISIS (Islamic State) and has been ... passed on to Hamas.\"',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'It’s a message to Israelis and the world that the Israeli military is preparing for an invasion, but it also carries clues on strategy that Hamas will have noted.\\n\\nOn Thursday, October 26, Israel released footage of a nighttime incursion into Gaza Strip. The Israeli military accompanied the heavily edited video with a statement claiming that “in preparation for the next stages of combat, the [Israeli military] operated in northern Gaza. [Israeli army] tanks & infantry struck numerous terrorist cells, infrastructure and anti-tank missile launch posts. The soldiers have since exited the area and returned to Israeli territory.”\\n\\nThe video is obviously intended as propaganda, to send a message both to Israeli society and to the outside world.\\n\\nIt attempts to tell Israel and the Israelis “we are not just sitting and waiting, we are doing something”. That is very important, as the Israeli military tries to counter doubts and uncertainties among the country’s population about why Israel hasn’t launched a full-fledged ground invasion of Gaza yet — despite saying it will go in soon — almost three weeks after the October 7 Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people in Israel.\\n\\nRather than openly confirm or deny hints that the civilian leadership and the military command may not exactly be seeing eye to eye, the Israeli military counters the doubts by the video. The Israeli army hopes that it will be read as “our military is preparing, doing something, trying and testing in real conditions”. If that message is well received and accepted, as Israeli propaganda masters intended, it would ease internal tensions. No citizen – no society – wants to be in a position where he or she asks whether their leadership is lying to them or concealing something?\\n\\nUnlike in most other countries, majority of Israelis serve in the armed forces and undergo regular refresher training where they are introduced to the latest tactics and technologies.\\n\\nThey are well prepared to judge military matters themselves. Most will immediately recognise that the force filmed consists of a tank company, with 12-15 formidable Merkava tanks, reinforced by armoured bulldozers and supported by long-range artillery from the rear. There are just glimpses of heavy armoured personnel carriers, but it is to be assumed that they would carry a company of infantry. Forces on the ground are assisted and monitored by aerial assets, from drones filming the action to successive layers of unmanned aerial vehicles, helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft that are not shown but are certainly deployed.\\n\\nIsraelis will see the video as well produced and timely. It surely eases tension and doubt, and tells them that their military forces can go in, and out, at will.\\n\\nPalestinian fighters in Gaza, and the rest of the world are looking at it with different eyes and for different reasons. Hamas armed wing is undoubtedly reading into the release from a tactical point of view, to judge what it can expect from its enemy and prepare for it.\\n\\nWhile I cannot rule out the possibility that the video is a total deception, intended to mislead the enemy into believing that Israel will attack in a way different from the one it demonstrates in its own propaganda, I believe that, at this stage, of preparations that would be too far-fetched. It would be confusing for units to fight in one way for the cameras and then radically change operational methods in a matter of days for the real battle.\\n\\nDespite its primary intention to convey a targeted message, it reveals much more – possibly even what the Israeli military never intended to divulge at this stage.\\n\\nFirstly, it confirms what I predicted almost a week ago: Israelis will breech their own concrete barriers using the ubiquitous armed bulldozers that will lead the armoured column through the gap. The video shows one bulldozer digging up the mines with its powerful shovel, the second sweeping them to the sides, widening the advance lane, allowing the follow-on vehicles to bypass any tank or armoured personnel carrier that is unable to advance. A recovery tank is, expectedly, included in the force, to tow back any armour incapacitated either by landmines or Hamas ground teams, rockets from multiple launchers or anti-tank missiles.\\n\\nThe most revealing details from the video concern the tactics of deployment of tanks and accompanying infantry. Usually, tanks in contact with the enemy extend and advance in parallel over a wide front, with tanks side-by-side, spaced 20-50 metres (66-164 feet) apart.\\n\\nThey are accompanied and closely followed by dismounted infantry whose task is to deal with hidden opposing forces. Defenders who have had plenty of time to prepare could be lying in wait to hit the advancing armour from the close range of 100 metres (328 feet) or less. Only dismounted infantry offers a field of vision over a wide front to engage such opposition quickly and efficiently.\\n\\nBut the Israeli military forces are shown advancing in a line — a riskier way to approach determined defences. When tanks, and accompanying infantry, are spread wide, defenders have to cover very wide angles to re-aim from one target to another. The attacker has the advantage that several tanks can concentrate fire on any point in front of them. An attacker advancing in a column can engage enemy bunkers straight ahead of it with one gun only. If it is taken out of action the next in line must bypass it, risking uncleared minefields or non-discovered resistance points.\\n\\nThe video also shows infantry staying inside armoured vehicles during the advance. So, the Israeli military does not think it would encounter significant resistance in the first two to three kilometres (1.2-1.9 miles) of open desert and fields. A clear sign that Israel expects significant resistance only when forces reach the first buildings at the outskirts of Gaza City.\\n\\nFinally, the video suggests that the units will be commanded from the ground, at battalion level, covering the three or four companies involved in each line of advance. It also confirms that Israeli commanders will have a clear tactical overview of the battlefield from numerous drones like the one that filmed the video. Higher commands might only monitor and coordinate but crucial real-time decisions on the ground will be made by experienced operational lieutenant colonels.\\n\\nThe video does not help answer the biggest question: Will there be a ground offensive? But the world — and Hamas, no doubt — will have taken note.',\n",

In a major development, Israeli security forces have roped in spyware firms like Pegasus maker to track hostages in the Gaza strip, reported Bloomberg citing sources.\\n\\nAlong with Israel, countries like Italy and the US are also keen to bring back the hostages before negotiating on ceasefire in the ongoing war. However, firms like NSO Group and Candiro, both of which are blacklisted by the US, are being asked to quickly upgrade their spyware capabilities to meet needs laid out by the country\\'s security forces, four cybersecurity industry sources told BB. The news was also confirmed by an Israeli government official.\\n\\nThe two firms, along with several other software firms, are collaborating on the requests and largely offering their services for free, sources told BB on request of anonymity. Till now there has been no official confirmation by the Defense Ministry on the news. Moreover, the Israeli Defense Forces and NSO also declined to comment.\\n\\nThe other US-blacklisted firm, Candiru, offered to assist the war effort in any way needed, the company said in a statement on Thursday. Hamas militants have held more than 200 people captive in Gaza. The recent level of violence in Gaza has led to broad support for an invasion. Whereas, the Western governments are pushing for more negotiations, and US President Joe Biden asked PM Benjamin Netanyahu to pause the ground offensive for the safety of hostages on Wednesday.\\n\\nOther hostage rescue possibilities for Israel\\n\\nSince the beginning of the war, Israel has been trying to bring back hostages via diplomatic routes with the help of Qatar and Egypt. As the efforts are yielding no result, Israel has been discussing other hostage-rescuing possibilities with other governments which have offered intelligence and expertise on how to extract people.\\n\\nMore than half of the hostages have foreign passports, including agriculture workers, visitors, and people with dual citizenship. Four hostages have been freed since the fighting began. The surprise attack by Hamas on October 7 that took lives of more than 1,400 innocent Israelis, mostly civilians. The surprise assault by Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the US and European Union, marked the deadliest-ever strike on Israel.\\n\\nSince the attack, Israel has responded with heavy air bombardments on Gaza, killing thousands of Palestinians according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run enclave. Israel\\'s preparation to launch a ground invasion of Gaza has sparked fear among Palestinians of another ethnic cleansing.\\n\\nAbout NSO\\'s Pegasus software\\n\\nEarlier, the US sanctioned NSO and Candiro for helping authoritarian regimes track journalists and dissidents. NSO\\'s Pegasus software is sold to governments and law enforcement agencies. Governments use this software to hack into mobile phones and covertly record emails, phone calls, and text messages.\\n\\nAmnesty International, Citizen Lab, and Forensic Architecture in 2021 documented the use of spyware in more than 60 cases to target government critics in countries including Rwanda, Togo, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Morocco, and India. Several reports also suggested the use of Pegasus software by the Indian government. The US Commerce Department blacklisted NSO and Candiru that year, banning them from receiving export contracts from American companies.\\n\\n\"Exciting news!

Despite calls from some quarters for a ceasefire, there seems to be no end in sight for the suffering of Gaza’s two million residents.\\n\\nHaving long embraced the dehumanisation of the Palestinians, Israeli society is filled with rage and the primordial drive for revenge over the killing of Israeli civilians by Hamas fighters on October 7.\\n\\nThis blind fury is now channelled into a genocidal drive by the narcissism and extremism of one man: Benjamin Netanyahu, a doubled-faced, pathological liar, who has done everything and anything to stay in power.\\n\\nNetanyahu’s arrogance, corruption and callousness are to blame for the country’s political and military failures that led to the October 7 attacks. He thought he could just transform all of historic Palestine into a Greater Land of Israel, by making the occupation of the Palestinian territories permanent and keeping millions of Palestinians in an open-air prison in Gaza and segregated bantustans in the West Bank – all with no repercussions.\\n\\nOn October 7, his arrogance finally caught up with him, because arrogance breeds stupidity. Hubris turned into humiliation, and the fiasco into farce, or as Israelis say, using Arabic words, the fashla (failure) turned fadiha (scandal).\\n\\nAnd while Israel’s military and intelligence heads have accepted responsibility for their failures to prevent the attacks, Netanyahu has refrained from taking any responsibility, even though most Israelis blame him for their national tragedy.\\n\\nInstead of resigning, the shamed and shameless prime minister cum wartime leader has gone on to wage a sadistic war with no clear strategy or endgame.\\n\\nIn his genocidal offensive, Netanyahu has been aided and abetted by his former Western detractors, who until recently were expressing “concern” about his plans to undermine Israel’s judiciary, through his coalition of fanatics and fascists, in order to stay out of jail.\\n\\nFirst and foremost among them is US President Joe Biden, who went from snubbing Netanyahu for much of the year to embracing and shielding him from the wrath of Israelis and Arabs alike.\\n\\nBiden has committed America to Netanyahu’s genocidal war on Gaza, offering American arms, tactical assistance in urban warfare, and diplomatic leverage. He has ordered the deployment of two aircraft carriers in the Eastern Mediterranean to protect Israel and deter the likes of Iran from intervening in the conflict.\\n\\nLikewise, European leaders, who had also given Netanyahu the cold shoulder for much of the year, are now clamouring to show their support for his government and his war on Gaza. They have refused to call for a ceasefire and continued to justify the mounting Israeli war crimes as an exercise of “the right to self-defence”.\\n\\nIsrael’s Western stooges love to evoke international law in all the wrong ways. Israel, indeed, has the right to self-defence, but not to defend its decades-long brutal military occupation, long enabled by Western powers. It is rather the occupied and victimised Palestinian people living under the Israeli racist system of apartheid that have the right to resist their tormentor under international law.\\n\\nThe ongoing genocidal war – spearheaded by a failed prime minister and supported by his morally suspect Western allies – is not one of self-defence; rather, it is a war of self-deceit. Israel falsely believes that it could attain security by the sword.\\n\\nBut when has killing more Palestinians ever resulted in better security for Israeli society? It never has; it never will.\\n\\nImposing a hermetic blockade on Gaza and unleashing a bombing rampage to pave the way for a land invasion, Israel will face dangerous regional blowbacks. In its genocidal drive, it may, as some fear, drag the US into World War III.\\n\\nSensationally and falsely comparing Hamas’s attacks on Israel with those carried by al-Qaeda on the United States in 2001 will not help. The “war on terror” the US unleashed on the world killed even more Americans than the 9/11 attacks did, along with hundreds of thousands of mostly Muslim victims. It sowed chaos that more war and more troops could not stop for the past two decades.\\n\\nIf anything, the “war on terror” proves that war crimes, collective punishment and other violations of international law do not mitigate extremism; they perpetuate it as they fuel the cycles of violence – something UN Special Rapporteur on Counter-Terrorism Fionnuala Ni Aolain emphasised during a recent news conference focusing on the Israeli war on Gaza.\\n\\nAs the Israeli army commits more war crimes against the Palestinians of Gaza, Israelis need to have a good look at where colonialism and occupation have gotten them. Perpetual Israeli oppression, racism and killings of the Palestinians have created the conditions for greater instability, extremism and violence in Palestine and the region.\\n\\nA genocidal war on Gaza will not bring peace and quiet to the Israeli society, nor to those in the West abetting it.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'October 27, 2023 12:10 am | Updated 02:09 pm IST\\n\\nAfter a prolonged spell of costly indecisiveness, the U.S. House of Representatives has finally elected a Speaker, Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana. Recent weeks have seen convulsions rock the House as Republicans struggled to find a consensus candidate to lead the majority in the Lower Chamber of Congress. After the political debacle of the ouster of the previous Speaker Kevin McCarthy on October 3, laying bare the deeply factionalised landscape of the House Republican caucus, several party notables tried and failed to secure the confidence of the House majority in their bids for the top post. Initially, multiple closed-door meetings failed to produce a consensus candidate. Heavyweights including Tom Emmer of Minnesota, Jim Jordan of Ohio and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, were unable to secure the gavel by cornering the minimum of 217 votes, despite being nominated to the role. While Mr. Johnson has now emerged as the Speaker, second in line for the U.S. presidency, after much confabulations and voting, the politically messy process of his win signals serious deadlock in the party and the Chamber.\\n\\nIn a sense, the intra-party fractures that impeded the House Republican caucus from taking forward funding bills relating to the U.S. federal government, Israel and Ukraine, reflect the contradictions between the Congressmen who support and are supported by former President Donald Trump on the one hand, and those who are not in that category, on the other. Shortly after Mr. Emmer pulled out of the contest, Mr. Trump described him on social media as a “Rino”, or ‘Republican in Name Only’, who “never respected the power of a Trump endorsement or the breadth and scope of MAGA”, and that it would be “a tragic mistake” to support him. Trump acolytes in the House took their cue from the 45th President, it appears, and they are a sizeable cohort. Looking beyond the political embarrassment of this rupture, it portends trouble for the Grand Old Party in the 2024 presidential election. It certainly does appear at this time as though Mr. Trump will win his party’s nomination by a considerable margin. However, many “traditional” conservatives do not side with him on hot button issues, including criminal charges that he faces, for example for obstructing justice in seeking to delegitimise the results of the 2020 presidential election. If the House’s Speaker saga indicates anything, it is that the dissonances within the Republican Party will sooner or later be manifested in popular anger among conservatives, and that might be an even greater barrier to Mr. Trump’s political ambitions than the opposition he faces from Democrats.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': \"In Gaza, surgeons are operating by flashlights, rationing anesthetics, and running out of precious fuel needed to keep patients alive.\\n\\nAs the World Health Organization reports that more than one-third of the city’s hospitals are no longer operating and Israel’s bombing continues, health care professionals fear the worst.\\n\\n“The health system here is in its last throes before it completely boots down. If the electricity goes, that’s it. It just becomes a mass grave,” says Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a British-Palestinian plastic and reconstructive surgeon who has been working at Al-Shifa hospital over the last two weeks. “There’s no hospital, if there’s no electricity.”\\n\\nRead More: ‘Our Death Is Pending.’ Stories of Loss and Grief From Gaza\\n\\nRight now, his sense is that it will be “days, rather than weeks,” until Al-Shifa runs out of fuel needed to keep the hospital running. Palestine’s Ministry of Health said Tuesday that hospital generators will stop running in 48 hours, and aid workers tell TIME that the city is expected to run out of fuel on Wednesday evening.\\n\\nMore From TIME\\n\\nThe situation is particularly dire for neonatal babies. Dr. Hatem Edhair, the head of the neonatal intensive care unit at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, fears that electricity shutting off will mean five babies dependent on ventilators will die. “If there is no electricity, it means the end of their life… because oxygen will not be available,” he says.\\n\\nDr. Ahmed Mhanna, manager of Al-Awda hospitals in northern Gaza, said Monday that the hospital only had enough fuel to run another three to four days. They have been relying on two generators that have been consuming more than 13 liters per hour, he says. “If there’s no fuel, it means the generator will stop. If the generator will stop, the hospital will stop. We will close,” he says.\\n\\nMhanna is unfazed by the sound of a blast while on a phone interview with TIME. Asked whether he wants to cut the call, he responds: “No, it’s OK: they are bombing everywhere all the time.”\\n\\n“We are feeling absolutely unsafe in the hospital. We are worried, we are afraid, we are human beings but we cannot do anything except continue our mission with our patients,” he says.\\n\\nSo far, Israeli attacks have killed more than 6,400 people and injured more than 17,000 people in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health run out of the West Bank. More than half are women and children. The Palestinian Ministry of Health also reports 73 medical personnel have been killed, more than 100 have been wounded, and 25 ambulances are out of service.\\n\\nAyman Abu Shamalah stands next to his daughter Mecca as she receives care inside an incubator at a hospital in Rafah on October 23, 2023. An Israeli strike killed his children and his wife, Dareen Abu Shamalah. Mai Yaghi—AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThe airstrikes follow Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed more than 1,400 people. As the U.S. works to funnel more than $14 billion in aid for Israel, pro-Palestinian advocates and aid groups are calling for a ceasefire with little success.\\n\\nRead More: The Gaza Healthcare System Is Reportedly on the Brink of Collapse\\n\\nThe sheer number of injured Palestinians means Al-Shifa is operating well beyond its maximum capacity of about 700 patients—instead dealing with between 1,700 to 1,900 people, Abu-Sittah says. Hospital compounds have become makeshift tent cities—not only for patients but also civilians seeking shelter. “You feel that there’s a public health catastrophe waiting to happen,” Abu-Sittah says.\\n\\nSo many people in such a small space, with inadequate access to hygiene and sanitation, can lead to an outbreak of infectious diseases, he says. Having dead bodies remain in the streets is another source of potential infection, health experts warn.\\n\\nAl-Shifa hospital also can’t sterilize surgical equipment properly. Abu-Sittah has been going out to the corner store to buy bottles of vinegar and laundry detergent to clean wounds. He feels forced to cut some surgeries short because of how many patients he needs to treat. “Everyday you make more and more compromises about what you can and can’t do,” Abu-Sittah says.\\n\\nEven Edhair’s hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza—Israel had ordered a mass evacuation from northern to southern Gaza on Oct. 13—has had its share of nearby explosions. Last week, he says two airstrikes landed near the hospital, causing mothers to flee their rooms, crying. “This is terrifying,” he says. “We all are afraid of war. I want everyone to know we are civilians.” On Monday morning, he found an airstrike just 500 meters from his home, he says. His mother told him not to go to the hospital but he refused to listen.\\n\\nMore than 20 hospitals have been asked to evacuate in the northern Gaza strip, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The Israeli government called Al-Awda hospitals less than a week ago and told Mhanna personally they have to evacuate staff and patients, he says. “I refused, of course, because where can I deal with my patients? All the hospitals in Gaza are overcrowded, people are lying in corridors.”\\n\\n“A crime is a crime, even if you make it by appointment.” - Dr. Ghassan Abu-Sittah\\n\\nAl-Shifa Hospital has received similar warnings. “Giving notice by telling hospitals that they need to evacuate—knowing very well that’s not possible—does not make targeting hospitals less of a war crime,” Abu-Sittah says. “A crime is a crime, even if you make it by appointment.”\\n\\nAnd as hospitals switch to caring for the victims of recent violence, routine care is almost impossible to provide.\\n\\n“When we think about war, we often focus on the victims of airstrikes… but ordinary lives don't stop. Women still go into labor. They still have miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, preterm births, and hemorrhages,” says Dr. Brenda Kelly, a consultant obstetrician in Oxford, U.K. Many operating theaters in Gaza are now dealing with trauma-related injuries, leaving less room to treat pregnant women.\\n\\nRead More: What Aid Groups Say Gaza Needs\\n\\nMelanie Ward, CEO of Medical Aid for Palestinians, a U.K. based nonprofit, is particularly worried about disruptions to routine care, such as kidney dialysis and cancer. More than 1,000 kidney dialysis patients have had their session time reduced from four hours to 2.5 hours per patient, according to Palestine’s Ministry of Health. About 9,000 cancer patients rely on chemotherapy to stay alive and the only hospital providing this service is running on a single generator expected to stop working within 24-48 hours, the ministry noted.\\n\\nShe says the group has already released more than half a million dollars worth of medical supplies to hospitals across Gaza. But it’s not enough. “Some operations have been conducted without anesthesia, which I find barbaric,” she says. “We do not live in the middle ages.”\\n\\nDr. Omar Abdel-Mannan, a British-Egyptian senior pediatric neurology resident in London, co-founded the social media account @GazaMedicVoices, which shares firsthand accounts from health care professionals in the city. He says hospitals in Gaza were running on fumes even before recent airstrikes, as the city has been facing a blockade for more than a decade.\\n\\nOne story that haunts Abdel-Mannan is from a pediatric intensive care doctor in Gaza who said she was torn between helping two patients who arrived at the intensive care unit. “She had to basically let one not survive and choose the other one to keep them alive,” he says. “She was heartbroken over the idea that she’s having to make these decisions that almost feel like you’re playing God…because of the sheer volume of patients coming through the door.”\\n\\nIn the meantime, doctors are feeling powerless—not only about dwindling supplies but about the scale of casualties. On Monday, after Abu-Sittah finished operating on a young Palestinian girl, he tried to console her, saying that her procedure went well and she was alright. “She said to me: things will never be alright: they killed my mom and dad.”\",\n",

Vote for humanitarian aid to reach those whose very survival depends on it. Vote to stop this madness,” Palestine’s UN ambassador Riyad Mansour said in an emotional speech to the UN General Assembly on Thursday.\\n\\nThe Palestinian foreign minister also addressed the UN Security Council at a special session this week, but as a non-member observer state, Palestine is not able to participate in the same way as full UN member states.\\n\\nAs UN members continue to discuss how they will respond to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, here is a quick guide to Palestine’s status at the UN.\\n\\nNon-member observer\\n\\nIn 2012, the majority of the 193 members of the General Assembly voted to grant Palestine non-member observer status.\\n\\nA total of 138 of the UN General Assembly’s 193 members voted yes, while nine voted no and 46 abstained or did not vote.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmong the countries that voted no were the United States, Israel and Canada as well as Pacific Island nations including Nauru and Palau.\\n\\nNon-member state observer status is not officially recognised in the UN Charter but has a long history. It was first held by Switzerland and is currently held only by Palestine and the Holy See, also known as the Vatican.\\n\\nThe decision to grant Palestine non-member status was far from the first, or last time, the General Assembly has voted on Palestine.\\n\\nIn 1947, the then-members of the UN General Assembly voted on a resolution titled the future government of Palestine.\\n\\nThe resolution decided that Palestine would be “[partitioned into two states” with the creation of “Independent Arab and Jewish States” as well as a “Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem”.\\n\\nThe resolution passed with 33 of the then-57 members of the UN General Assembly voting yes.\\n\\nThe number of members of the UN at the time was significantly smaller than it is today, as dozens of present member states had yet to gain independence from European colonial powers.\\n\\nTwo years later, in 1949, the State of Israel was admitted to the UN as its 59th member.\\n\\nWho represents Palestine?\\n\\nOn Tuesday this week, Palestine’s Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki addressed the UN Security Council open debate.\\n\\nAl-Maliki is part of the Palestinian Authority, which is led by a different political grouping to Hamas, which controls Gaza.\\n\\nThe Palestinian Authority continues to represent Palestinians at the UN although at home its authority to govern on behalf of all Palestinians is complicated.\\n\\nCould Palestine become a full UN member?\\n\\nIn 2019, the UN General Assembly voted to allow Palestine to temporarily exercise limited additional powers while it chaired the Group of 77, a grouping at the UN which originally had 77 members, but now has more than 130.\\n\\nOne of the countries that opposed the temporary measure was Australia.\\n\\nGillian Bird, Australia’s ambassador to the UN at the time told the General Assembly that Australia voted no because it saw “Palestinian attempts to seek recognition as a state in international fora [as] deeply unhelpful to efforts toward a two-state solution.”\\n\\nWhile the General Assembly casts votes on new proposed members, it is the Security Council which decides which candidates are considered.\\n\\nThe council has 15 members, but the five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the US – have the power of veto. The US has used it some 34 times to block resolutions critical of Israel.\\n\\nWho gets to vote?\\n\\n“When the Security Council is unable to act, the General Assembly must step up,” Dennis Francis, the president of the General Assembly, said when he called a special meeting of the General Assembly this week at the request of Jordan, Mauritius and several other countries.\\n\\nNEW: Arab Group circulates amended #UNGA draft resolution to #UN member states which replaces call for \"immediate ceasefire\" in #Gaza/#Israel with a call for \"an immediate, durable & sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities.\" Amended draft now… https://t.co/KoWtWmCnMI pic.twitter.com/niilXg3X7N — Rami Ayari (@Raminho) October 26, 2023\\n\\nUnlike the Security Council, which has only 15 members, the UN General Assembly includes all 193 of the UN’s member states.\\n\\nVotes in the UN General Assembly are also less complicated than in the Security Council, where resolutions have often been blocked by the permanent veto. China, Russia and the United States have all used their veto to block Security Council resolutions on Israel-Gaza in the last two weeks.\\n\\nBut while UN General Assembly members do sometimes take a different approach to Palestine than the UN Security Council, UN General Assembly resolutions are considered less legally binding than Security Council resolutions, especially when it comes to the currently much-contested calls for ceasefires.\\n\\nAs both UN bodies continue to consider their carefully worded resolutions, Mansour reminded UN members to “remember we are meeting here while Palestinians in Gaza are under the bombs”.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Mumbai: From alleging there are hundreds of “Gaza Strips” within India and claiming Hindus face an imminent “Hamas-like” Islamist attack and insisting that only Prime Minister Narendra Modi can save India from it, to expressing glee at the deaths of Palestinians and claiming the Congress was behind the attacks, pro-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) right-wing online spaces are furiously peddling Islamophobia and targeting the BJP’s rivals with disinformation, by using the Israel-Hamas war as cover.\\n\\nWithin pro-BJP WhatsApp groups as well as Facebook pages and groups, named after BJP leaders, social media users have weaponised the ongoing war to push their Hindutva agendas deeper by training their guns at a familiar target: Muslims.\\n\\nUsing photos and videos, along with text messages, the messaging in these groups seeks to convince users that Islam and Muslims were to be singularly blamed for the war. Simultaneously, it dehumanises the sufferings of Palestinians by branding them as “jihadis” and “terrorists”.\\n\\nSince October 7, when Hamas launched air and land attacks against Israel, over 1,400 Israelis and nearly 6,000 Palestinians have been killed. Among the Palestinians are over 2,300 children who were killed in Israeli bombing.\\n\\nYet, across these groups, jokes about their deaths as well as mocking their suffering were common.\\n\\nPrateek Waghre, policy director at the Internet Freedom Foundation, said such messaging was part of a broader trend concerning propaganda in Indian right-wing spaces. “There has been a definite tendency over the last few years in India to try to incorporate global events into the constant narrative that paints mostly Muslims but sometimes even moderate Hindus as an enemy or a threat,” said Waghre.\\n\\nMuch of this, Waghre said, was owing to the “religious angle” of the conflict between the Jewish state of Israel and the Muslim-dominated Palestine.\\n\\nThis author accessed 13 WhatsApp groups, all of them expressing clear support for the Hindutva ideology, the BJP, Narendra Modi and the RSS through the names of the groups as well as the display photos, generally featuring images of Modi and Adityanath. The groups are not being named to protect the author’s access. The number of members in these groups range from anywhere around 50 to nearly 400. In addition, the author accessed multiple Facebook groups and pages, which displayed open affiliations to the BJP and its leaders.\\n\\nBroadly, much of the propaganda in these groups falls under four different themes – from dehumanising Palestinian suffering and delegitimising support for them, to making the Israel-Gaza war relatable by drawing historical Indian comparisons to it, to warning Hindus about an Islamist attack and pitching the BJP and Modi as the country’s only hope to fight this.\\n\\n‘Just like Kashmiri Hindus’\\n\\nA significant proportion of messages on these groups attempts to try and make the war more relevant to an Indian audience. It does this by drawing parallels to the situation, but selectively.\\n\\nThe plight of Israelis, these messages insist, is like Kashmiri Hindus. Circulating a video, ostensibly of an Israeli family held hostage by Hamas terrorists, the message asks readers to “look at the fear” on their faces. “This is the same what Kashmiri Hindus faced in 1990 (sic),” the message says. The purpose behind the comparison becomes clear at the end of the message: “Indian wokes will call it RSS propoganda, in reality ISLAM IS PEACE LOVING RELIGION (sic),” it says, sarcastically.\\n\\nSimilarly, Hamas is equated to “Islamic invaders” like Humayun and Babur, both of them ostensibly attacking non-Muslims with similar brutality. The corollary of these comparisons comes in a later bunch of messaging: referring to the violence by Hamas, the messages would remind readers of ‘Jauhar’, believed to be the practice of self-immolation by the wives and children of warriors in medieval times when the warrior was facing defeat. One meme shows a photo of a half-covered body, purportedly of an Israeli woman being dragged by Hamas terrorists. “To Avoid This Our Hindu Women Did Jauhar During Mughals Era,” reads a caption with the image. This is a commonly-circulated message.\\n\\nOn a Facebook page named ‘Yogi Adityanath for PM 2024’, with over 66,000 followers, the administrator of the page posts a similar message: “Hamas has made us understand why Hindu women committed Jauhar.”\\n\\n‘A warning for you’\\n\\nHaving convinced members of these groups that the war was a relatable one, a large strand of messaging is focused on stoking fears of an imminent attack on Indians, but especially Hindus, by Hamas-like Islamist terrorists.\\n\\n“In the future, India could also face conspiracies and attacks like Israel. The possibility of Hindu women facing cruelty can’t be ruled out,” the viral message warns. To avoid this, the message adds, Hindus needed to be alert and do two things: carry weapons and carry out a complete social boycott of Muslims.\\n\\nSome messages claim Israel used to let 2,000 Palestinians from Gaza into Israel everyday. These 2,000, apparently, were secretly carrying out reconnaissance missions for the Hamas and “were terrorists in disguise”, the messages claim. Then, the message points to the Muslims within India, without naming them. “Now imagine, we have 15 crore terrorists amidst us, who we think share our DNA,” the message concludes.\\n\\nThe messaging in these groups doesn’t just stop at warning of impending attacks, but goes a step further and asks its audience to imagine how the conflict would even play out, and stokes anger against Islamic nations.\\n\\n“When the civil war begins in India, do you think the 59 Islamic countries will stand by you? They will stand by the Muslims,” it insists. “You will always be the kaafir for them.”\\n\\nAmidst these warnings, one popular strand of messaging launches stinging attacks on the Congress, using disinformation and outright manufactured facts.\\n\\nOne, for instance, found on both WhatsApp and Facebook, insists that the nation should, after the Israel-Hamas war, be grateful to Nathuram Godse, the man who killed Mahatma Gandhi. “If not for him, India would have had a 3,000-kilometre long Gaza patti (strip) across the country,” it says, while being accompanied by an image the Indian sub-continent, showing a green corridor cutting through India, connecting Pakistan and Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan). These messages disparagingly call Gandhi “Ganduji” and claim that he had accepted this proposal by Jinnah for such a corridor. However,fact-checking sites have repeatedly debunked claims that Gandhi accepted such a proposal.\\n\\nMany messages blame the Congress for these attacks by Hamas and claim that former PM Rajiv Gandhi had given Yasser Arafat, the chief of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, a “peace prize”. This was a lie: Arafat received the ‘Indira Gandhi Award For International Justice and Harmony’ award in New Delhi, but this was given to him by the Indian Council of World Affairs. The award, in fact, was given in January 1992, while Gandhi had been assassinated in May 1991. V.P. Singh was the prime minister during the time of the ceremony, and the government was, incidentally, supported by the BJP. But the messages make no mention of this.\\n\\nDelegitimise support for Palestine\\n\\nMost of these groups are full of videos and photos, purportedly of the war, showing the civilian casualties of the war, except they are almost exclusively meant to show the sufferings of Israelis, while mocking at the sufferings of Palestinians.\\n\\nThese groups joke about how Palestinians, conflated with terrorists, were going to be rewarded with ‘hoors’, beautiful girls when they go to heaven after their deaths.\\n\\nAnother viral image across many of these groups is a badly-damaged structure, in ruins, which resembles a stairway going nowhere. The groups, quoting the image, express glee at how Palestinians were now directly going to gain entry into jannat, heaven.\\n\\nThis constant dehumanising of their sufferings, then, also extends to expressing support towards them.\\n\\nIn constant messages and memes, those backing Palestinians are described as “snakes”.\\n\\n“No shortage of snakes in India,” one message describes protests against Israeli air strikes targeting civilians.\\n\\n‘I am just in the way’\\n\\nA very frequent presence across these groups is of the prime minister, Narendra Modi.\\n\\nA popular, common message across groups was an image of a grim Modi, staring straight back and asking readers to realise “what’s happening in Israel can happen in Bharat!!”\\n\\nThe message serves both as a warning for Hindus and as an endorsement of Modi. The attack is imminent and Modi is the only person who can save Hindus from such an attack.\\n\\n“In reality, they are not after me, they are after you. I am just in the way,” reads a caption around Modi’s photo.\\n\\nAnother viral piece of propaganda has photos of Modi, home minister Amit Shah and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, asking people to be grateful “before you sleep tonight” to these three, for keeping India safe. It does not make mention of any terror attacks that occurred during the last nine years.\\n\\nSuch endorsements of Modi go hand-in-hand with messages stoking hate and anger against Muslims.\\n\\nA video, featuring Modi, is repeatedly circulated across these groups. In the video, undated, Modi is seen talking about Muslims. “They have divided the world into three parts,” Modi says, going on to talk about ‘Dar al-Aman’, ‘Dar al-Harab’ and ‘Dar al-Islam’, which he explains as ‘land of peace’, ‘land of conflict’ and the third being “to convert the whole world into Islam”.\\n\\nThis video is accompanied by the same caption in all these groups: “I will vote for Modi 100 times for a Safe India what ever may come in the way. He explained this before 20+ years (sic).”\\n\\nSimilar messages, while warning of an impending Islamic attack on India, pitch Modi as the perfect counter for this. Messages ask supporters to forget about concerns like “cheap petrol” and “free ration”, warning that there were “countless traitors inside the country”. It asks readers to remember the plight of Ukrainians.\\n\\nWithout naming Modi, these messages ask voters to vote for a “STRONG LEADER”.\\n\\nKunal Purohit is an independent journalist, writing on politics, gender, development, migration and the intersections between them.',\n",

So what if the Supreme Court has repeatedly red-flagged it, calling it “a callous exercise of exceptional power” and “a pernicious trend… in Telangana…”.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• The Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of BootLeggers, Dacoits, Drug-Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders, Land-Grabbers, Spurious Seed Offenders, Insecticide Offenders, Fertiliser Offenders, Food Adulteration Offenders, Fake Document Offenders, Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, Gaming Offenders, Sexual Offenders, Explosive Substances Offenders, Arms Offenders, Cyber Crime Offenders and White Collar or Financial Offenders Act, (PD Act), 1986-Know its key features\\n\\n• What is Preventive detention law?\\n\\n• Under what laws can the state order preventive detention?\\n\\n• For Your Information-Among central legislations, the National Security Act, the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA) are examples of laws under which preventive detention can be ordered.\\n\\nAs many as 25 states also have preventive detention legislations, like the Telangana law, which is called The Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of BootLeggers, Dacoits, Drug-Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders, Land-Grabbers, Spurious Seed Offenders, Insecticide Offenders, Fertiliser Offenders, Food Adulteration Offenders, Fake Document Offenders, Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, Gaming Offenders, Sexual Offenders, Explosive Substances Offenders, Arms Offenders, Cyber Crime Offenders and White Collar or Financial Offenders Act, (PD Act), 1986.\\n\\nThese are expansive laws specifically addressed to local law and order issues.

At the end of 2021, Telangana had as many as 396 detainees under this special law.\\n\\nPreventive detention laws give powers to the police to arrest an individual to maintain “public order.” The detention orders are examined by an advisory board, also formed by the state. Crucially, a detainee is not allowed legal representation before the advisory board and the law under Section 8(2) allows the state to not disclose the grounds of detention if it considers it to be “against the public interest.”\\n\\n“Public order” is defined broadly in the explanation to Section 2(a) of the law as encompassing situations that cause “harm, danger or alarm or a feeling of insecurity among the general public or any section thereof or a grave wide-spread danger to life or public health”.\\n\\n“Preventive detention is an exceptional law to be used sparingly. When it is applied to simply circumvent bail and continue keeping a person in jail, it violates due process,” said senior advocate Mohana Reddy, whose practice mostly focuses on preventive detention.\\n\\nBoth the Supreme Court and the Telangana High Court have underlined while striking down detention orders that preventive detention cannot be invoked to circumvent granting of bail — that the state cannot detain an accused when he is likely to be released on bail for the same offences.\\n\\n• What Supreme Court said about the same act?\\n\\n• What Telangana High Court said about the same act?\\n\\n• For Your Information-In a ruling on September 4, an apex court bench of Justices Surya Kant and Dipankar Dutta noted that “a pernicious trend prevalent in the state of Telangana has not escaped our attention” while striking down a detention order that was issued to prevent the accused from being released on bail.\\n\\nIn a judgment in April 2022, a Supreme Court Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud had termed Telangana’s use of the preventive detention law “a callous exercise of the exceptional power”. And called upon the state to “evaluate the fairness of the detention order against lawful standards”.\\n\\n• Article 22 grants protection to persons who are arrested or detained-know them in detail\\n\\n• Detention is of two types, namely, punitive and preventive-Know them in detail\\n\\n• Punitive Detention and Preventive Detention-Compare and Contrast\\n\\n• Article 22 confers certain rights on a person who is arrested or detained under an ordinary law-What are they?\\n\\n• What are the powers of the state?\\n\\n• How do courts assess the detention orders?\\n\\n• For Your Information-Article 22 prescribes protection against arrest and detention but has a major exception. It says in Article 22 (3) (b) that none of those safeguards apply “to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention.” The remaining clauses — Article 22(4)-(7) — deal with how preventive detention operationalises.\\n\\nFirst, the state, which would be the district magistrate, would issue an order to detain a person when it is necessary to maintain “public order.” The state can delegate this power to the police as well.\\n\\nIf the detention ordered is for more than three months, under Article 22(4), such a detention requires the approval of an Advisory Board. These Boards are set up by states and normally consist of retired judges and bureaucrats. A detainee is generally not allowed legal representation before the Board. If the Board confirms the detention, the detainee can move Court challenging the detention order.\\n\\nArticle 22(5) of the Constitution mandates that the state is required “as soon as maybe,” to communicate to the detainee the grounds of detention and “shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order.”\\n\\nA basic set of facts that are the grounds for detention are required to be communicated in one instalment, and the state cannot then add fresh, new or additional grounds to strengthen its original detention order. The grounds have to be read in a language that the detainee understands.\\n\\nHowever, even this safeguard is diluted to a certain extent by Article 22(6), which says that nothing in clause 5 shall require the state to “disclose facts that the state considers to be “ against the public interest to disclose.”\\n\\nFor preventive detention, there are very narrow grounds of judicial review because the Constitution emphasises the state’s “subjective satisfaction” when ordering a detention. The touchstone on which the order is examined is this subjective opinion of the state rather than the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. When the Court cannot substitute the subjective satisfaction of the state with its own satisfaction, it essentially means that it cannot check the veracity of the facts mentioned in the grounds of detention.\\n\\nA judicial review is limited to whether the Advisory Board applied its mind, considered all material facts and whether the state showed obvious malafide in ordering detention. Because judicial review is limited, courts often strike down detention orders on technical grounds, such as delay in the decision of the advisory board, communication of grounds in a timely fashion and in a language that the detainee understands, etc.\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍Telangana law under scanner: how preventive detention works\\n\\nGOVT & POLITICS\\n\\nLanka offers free visas to Indians to revive tourism\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance.\\n\\nMains Examination: General Studies II: India and its neighbourhood- relations.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story- The Sri Lankan foreign ministry on Tuesday announced Indians will get free visas to the nation as part of a pilot programme which will extend till March 31, 2024.\\n\\nThe move is aimed at reviving the country’s fledgling tourism industry and also extends to citizens from six other countries – Russia, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Japan.\\n\\n• India has traditionally been Sri Lanka’s top inbound tourism market, followed by China-Analyse\\n\\n• What is “border-less tourism” region?\\n\\n• Schengen area-what you know about this?\\n\\n• Is it feasible to establish a Schengen-like area in South Asia?\\n\\n• What is the current state of relations between India and Sri Lanka?\\n\\n• What is the significance of the bilateral relations between India and Sri Lanka?\\n\\n• What are the challenges facing in the bilateral relations between India and Sri Lanka?\\n\\n• India and Sri Lanka Bilateral Relations-Trust Deficit or Close Neighbours?\\n\\n• India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy-Know the key points\\n\\n• Map Work- Sri Lanka\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍New opportunities and a few old issues as Wickremesinghe comes calling\\n\\nCash for query: Echoes from 18 years ago when 11 MPs were expelled\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Indian Polity and Governance-Constitution, Political System, Panchayati Raj, Public Policy, Rights Issues, etc.\\n\\nMain Examination: General Studies II: Parliament and State legislatures—structure, functioning, conduct of business, powers & privileges and issues arising out of these.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story- ACCUSING HER of accepting money to ask questions in Parliament, BJP Lok Sabha MP Nishikant Dubey has hauled Trinamool Congress (TMC) parliamentarian Mahua Moitra before the House Ethics Committee, and now approached the Lokpal. Dubey accuses Moitra of taking “bribes” from businessman Darshan Hiranandani to ask questions against the Adani conglomerate, in return for “favours”.\\n\\nIn a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla seeking a probe, Dubey said the case was reminiscent of the 2005 cash-for-questions scam.\\n\\n• What is exactly cash for query case?\\n\\n• What is the procedure for raising the questions?\\n\\n• For Your Information-The procedure for raising questions is governed by Rules 32 to 54 of the “Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha” and Directions 10 to 18 of the “Directions by the Speaker, Lok Sabha‟.\\n\\nTo ask a question, an MP has to first give a notice addressed to the lower house’s Secretary-General, intimating their intention to ask a question. The notice usually contains the text of the question, the official designation of the Minister to whom the question is addressed, the date on which the answer is desired, and the order of preference, in case the MP tables more than one notice of questions for the same day.\\n\\n“A Member is allowed to give not more than five notices of questions, both for oral and written answers, in all, for any day. Notices received in excess of five from a Member for a day, are considered for the subsequent day(s) concerning that Minister(s) during the period of that session only,” according to a government document, ‘Question Hour in Lok Sabha’.\\n\\nUsually, the period of notice of a question isn’t less than 15 days.\\n\\nThere are two ways through which MPs can submit the notices of their questions. First, through an online ‘Member’s Portal’, where they have to enter their ID and password to get access. Second, through the printed forms available in the Parliamentary Notice Office.\\n\\nThe next stage is when the Speaker of Lok Sabha examines the notices of the questions in the light of the laid out rules. It is the Speaker, who decides if a question, or a part thereof, is or isn’t admissible.\\n\\n• What are the conditions for the admissibility of questions?\\n\\n• What are the different types of questions?\\n\\n• Do You Know-There are four different types of questions: starred, unstarred, short-notice questions and questions addressed to private Members.\\n\\nA starred question is asked by an MP and answered orally by the Minister-in-charge. Each MP is allowed to ask one starred question per day. Starred questions have to be submitted at least 15 days in advance (so that the Minister-in-charge has the time to prepare the answers) and only 20 questions can be listed for oral answers on a day. When a question is answered orally, supplementary questions can be asked thereon.\\n\\nAn unstarred question receives a written reply from the Ministry. These also need to be submitted at least 15 days in advance. Only 230 questions can be listed for written answers in a day. Unlike starred questions, unstarred questions don’t permit any follow-up questions.\\n\\nWhile starred questions are better suited to inquire about the government’s views on issues and its policy inclination, unstarred questions are more conducive for getting answers to queries related to data or information, according to a report by PRS Legislative Research.\\n\\nShort notice questions are ones pertaining to a matter of urgent public importance. They can be asked with less than 10 days’ notice, with reasons for the short notice. Like a starred question, they are answered orally, followed by supplementary questions.\\n\\nThe question to a private Member is addressed to the MP themselves. It is asked when the subject matter pertains to any Bill, Resolution or any matter relating to the Business of the House for which that MP is responsible.\\n\\n“For such questions, the same procedure is followed as in the case of questions addressed to a Minister with such variations as the Speaker may consider necessary or convenient,” the government document said.\\n\\n• What is the importance of raising questions?\\n\\n• What exactly is the Parliamentary Ethics Committee?\\n\\n• What is the primary role of the Ethics Committee?\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍Mahua Moitra and ‘cash for query’ row: How MPs ask questions in Lok Sabha\\n\\nTHE EDITORIAL PAGE\\n\\nBreathless in Mumbai\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: General issues on Environmental ecology, Bio-diversity and Climate Change – that do not require subject specialization.\\n\\nMains Examination: General Studies III: Conservation, environmental pollution and degradation, environmental impact assessment.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story- Among Indian metros, Delhi gets the most attention for its notoriously high pollution levels. But it has been evident for some time now that bad air problems affect large parts of the country. As a series in this newspaper has pointed out, Mumbai has experienced an air quality crisis during the post-monsoon period for the second consecutive year. For most of October so far, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Maharashtra’s capital has registered “moderate” or “poor”. The city has not had a single “good” air day this month.\\n\\n• Why has the air quality been bad in Mumbai of late?\\n\\n• “Mumbai’s overall Air Quality Index touched 191, way worse than Delhi’s 84”-how this happened?\\n\\n• What are the reasons given by experts for the worsening AQI in Mumbai?\\n\\n• “Meteorological conditions play a role in pollution. But it should be clear that the weather or climate cannot generate air pollution. Air quality deteriorates mainly due to anthropogenic sources of emissions, whether local or distant. Meteorological conditions only help to manoeuvre the pollutants in the air”-Discuss\\n\\n• “Mumbai’s geography gives it a distinct advantage”-How?\\n\\n• “The “usual” is becoming “unusual” and getting triggered by additional anthropogenic factors”-Cite the reasons for Mumbai pollution\\n\\n• Do You Know-Last winter, the city experienced record-breaking particulate pollution, which was largely related to the unusual triple dip La Nina conditions — understood as linked to climate change. An abnormal drop in surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean had a telling effect on coastal wind speeds around Mumbai. There was scarcely any wind reversal from across the Arabian Sea, which would otherwise occur every two to three days and disperse pollutants in the air. In other words, the emission from various anthropogenic sources was not cleaned up and the city experienced its worst air of the decade.\\n\\nLa Nina has gone this year. However, the withdrawal of the monsoon was delayed till October. The withdrawal time of monsoon always plays a critical role in Mumbai’s air quality. The withdrawal is always followed by an anticyclonic circulation that was right above Mumbai and the surrounding regions during the initial days of October. This led to weak ventilation in the city.\\n\\nAt the same time, the transport level winds, much above the surface in the atmosphere, were moderately fast and were blowing towards Mumbai from Lonavala and Khandala in the Sahyadri ranges, around 2,040 ft above sea level. These chilly moderate winds are capable of transporting pollutants towards Mumbai. When these winds started losing energy, they descended near Navi Mumbai and the surrounding coastal region. There they encountered warmer winds which were laden with local dust. When this dust-filled cloud pushed towards Mumbai, it was arrested because of the calm winds, deteriorating the city’s air quality. The fact that PM10 continues to be the major pollutant in the city and the visibility of Mumbai’s residents has been impacted suggests that the major blame for the current worsening of air quality should be ascribed to coarser particles, largely a result of dust emissions.\\n\\nMany development and construction activities are being undertaken across the city — these include the coastal corridor, work on the Metro and other digging activities. Unfavourable weather conditions exploit the emissions from such sources to create pollution. Under normal conditions, windblown dust contributes 26 per cent of PM10 and 19 per cent in PM2.5. However, the spike in pollution indicates that PM10 levels have gone up significantly. Under normal conditions, the transport sector contributes to 14 per cent of PM10 and 31 per cent of PM2.5. However, the stagnating conditions are likely to have caused a change in this mix.\\n\\n• What is the AQI and how does it calculate pollution?\\n\\n• What is PM 2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres) and PM 10 (particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers)?\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍Burning trash, choking air: How Mumbai civic agencies took their eyes off waste mountain\\n\\n📍Behind Mumbai’s poor air\\n\\nECONOMY\\n\\nUS bond yield hits 16-year high of 5%: Why it is rising and what does it signal?\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance.\\n\\nMain Examination: General Studies II: Effect of policies and politics of developed and developing countries on India’s interests.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story-On Monday (October 23), the yield on 10-year government bonds in the US, the benchmark for asset prices across the globe, rose to hit 5.02 per cent, its highest level since July 2007. Though the yield came down to 4.85 per cent later in the day, the rise capped a multi-week rout in bond prices as investors bet that the US Federal Reserve would keep interest rates at their current high levels for longer amid concerns over inflation spiking again due to high energy process.\\n\\nIn India, the yield on 10-year government bonds is already at a high of 7.38 per cent, a rise on 24 basis points in the last one month.\\n\\n• What’s bond yield?\\n\\n• For Your Information-A bond is a type of loan made by an investor to a borrower – a company or an institution – for a fixed period of time in return for regular interest payments. The yield on bond is the return an investor expects to receive each year over its term to maturity.\\n\\nFor the investor who has purchased the bond, the bond yield is a summary of the overall return that accounts for the remaining interest payments and principal they will receive, relative to the price of the bond. The prices at which investors buy and sell bonds in the secondary market move in the opposite direction to the yields. Rising bond yields could also have a cascading negative impact on equities.\\n\\n• Why yields are high?\\n\\n• What does it mean?\\n\\n• For Your Information-Historically, it was observed the bond yields in other countries, including India, rose when US yields showed any uptrend and vice versa. However, the quantum of increase varies depending on domestic factors. India’s 10-year yield rose by 162 basis points from 5.76 per cent (July 10, 2020) while US yields jumped by 400 bps to 5.02 per cent.\\n\\nThe rise indicates that the cost of funds in the financial system is rising and interest rates are on the upswing. The rising bond yield means the government will have to pay more as yield (or return to the investors), leading to a rise in cost of borrowings. This will have an overall impact on the financial system, putting upwards pressure on the general interest rates in the banking system.\\n\\nAnalysts say that rising yields hint at expectations of sticky and higher inflation coupled with possibilities of a rate hike or status quo on interest rates. US Fed has hiked interest rates by 500 basis points from 0.25-0.50 per cent to 5.25-5.50 per cent since May 2022. In short, rising yields put severe pressure on an upward movement in interest rates. Rising yields can also trigger a flight of capital from bank fixed deposits to sovereign guaranteed bonds as the differential in yields widen.\\n\\n• What’s the impact on bond investors?\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍Explained: Why bond yields are rising, and what it means for markets and investors\\n\\nEXPLAINED\\n\\n‘MOST GENDER-EQUAL’ ICELAND SEES WOMEN’S STRIKE: HERE IS WHY\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance.\\n\\nMain Examination: General Studies II: Effect of policies and politics of developed and developing countries on India’s interests\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story- Women of Iceland — often called the world’s most gender-equal country — went on a one-day strike on Tuesday (October 24) to protest against gender discrimination. The striking women were joined by the Prime Minister, Katrin Jakobsdóttir.\\n\\nFor 14 years in a row, Iceland has topped the World Economic Forum’s global gender gap rankings.\\n\\n• Map Work-Iceland\\n\\n• Why are women striking?\\n\\n• Do You Know-Iceland is a European island nation located in the North Atlantic Ocean, with a population of less than 4 lakh. Its women have made great strides in terms of representation in the workforce and legislation backing their right to equality. Many of these benefits came after a nationwide ‘women’s day off’ observed on October 24, 1975.\\n\\nHowever, 48 years on, two key areas of concern remain — pay gap and gender-based violence. According to a report in The Guardian, in some professions Icelandic women still earn 21% less than men, and more than 40% of women have experienced gender-based or sexual violence.\\n\\n“We’re seeking to bring attention to the fact that we’re called an equality paradise, but there are still gender disparities and urgent need for action,” said Freyja Steingrímsdóttir, a strike organiser and the communications director for the Icelandic Federation for Public Workers.\\n\\n• Who is striking?\\n\\n• What led to this strike?\\n\\n• What was the 1975 strike?\\n\\n• For Your Information-Since 1975, women have staged several hours-long strikes, but this is the first full-day action. The 1975 ‘day off’ saw the participation of almost 90% of the island’s working women. According to The NYT, schools and theaters were shut, and the national airline had to cancel flights as most of the flight attendants were women.\\n\\nA BBC report said, “Banks, factories and some shops had to close, as did schools and nurseries — leaving many fathers with no choice but to take their children to work. There were reports of men arming themselves with sweets and colouring pencils to entertain the crowds of overexcited children in their workplaces. Sausages — easy to cook and popular with children —were in such demand the shops sold out.”\\n\\nA year later, in 1976, Iceland passed a law granting equal rights irrespective of gender.\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍Iceland: In protest against wage disparity, women leave offices at 2.38 pm\\n\\nFor any queries and feedback, contact priya.shukla@indianexpress.com\\n\\nThe Indian Express UPSC Hub is now on Telegram.

       " {'articleBody': 'The fighting in Gaza, that has been raging for 20 days, following surprise attack by Hamas on Israel has shocked the world. Ever since the October 7 attack, Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry says more than 7,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s relentless retaliatory bombardments, mostly civilians and many of them children.\\n\\nHowever, the capture of hostages by Hamas, Israel’s use of phosphorus bombs and the cutting of food, water and electricity in Gaza have pointed out to the war crimes that are being done on the pretext of the conflict.\\n\\nWhile both Israel and Hamas have been accused of breaking international law during their latest conflict, the terms ‘crime against humanity’ and ‘war crimes’ can only be used under defined scenarios.\\n\\nHere is all you need to know about what are ‘war crimes’ and ‘crime against humanity’ and have Israel and Gaza committed war crimes in the Israel-Gaza conflict:\\n\\nWHAT ARE THE RULES OF WAR?\\n\\nThe international humanitarian laws during wars and conflicts are defined by the Geneva Conventions, drawn up after World War II and agreed on by almost every nation.\\n\\nThe four conventions agreed upon in 1949 set out that civilians, the wounded and prisoners must be treated humanely in wartime. They ban murder, torture, hostage-taking and “humiliating and degrading treatment” and require fighters to treat the other side’s sick and wounded.\\n\\nAnother set of rules in the law of war is the founding Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Set up in 2002, the ICC is the only global independent tribunal to probe the world’s worst crimes including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.\\n\\nThe ICC defines war crimes as acts including intentional attacks on civilians, civilian settlements or humanitarian workers, destroying property where not militarily necessary, sexual violence and unlawful deportation.\\n\\nOther agreements ban certain types of weapons, such as chemical or biological munitions. But not all countries have signed up to these.\\n\\nHow are War crimes Defined?\\n\\n“War crimes” and “crimes against humanity” were both defined in the 1998 Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court.\\n\\nA war crime is a serious violation of international law against civilians and combatants during armed conflict, a “grave breach” of the 1949 Geneva Conventions that established a legal framework for war after the Nuremberg tribunals of top Nazis.\\n\\nIt covers more than 50 scenarios, including killing, torture, rape and hostage-taking. It also includes deliberate attacks on undefended population centres that are not “military objectives.”\\n\\nA “crime against humanity” is defined as “a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population” including “murder” and “extermination” as well as “enslavement” and “deportation or forcible transfer”.\\n\\nHAS HAMAS COMMITTED WAR CRIMES?\\n\\nHamas, by firing thousands of rockets at Israeli towns and cities on October 7 and sending hundreds of gunmen across the border from Gaza has committed war crimes, experts have said.\\n\\nHaim Abraham, a lecturer in law at University College London, said the evidence of crimes is clear.\\n\\n“They massacred civilians at their homes. They kidnapped civilians, taking them hostage. All of these things are clearly war crimes,” Abraham said, according to AP.\\n\\nIt has also violated international law by taking hostages after a surprise attack. Israel has said Hamas has taken around 150 hostages, including Americans, Germans, Mexicans and Thais.\\n\\nJeanne Sulzer, a lawyer with the Commission for International Justice of Amnesty International France, said the Geneva Conventions state that “civilians should never be taken hostage. If they are, that may be characterized as a war crime.”\\n\\nPalestine is a state party of the Rome Statute of the ICC, which means that Hamas leaders and personnel can be held accountable for committing genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes if they are held guilty.\\n\\nHAS ISRAEL’S RETALIATION BEEN LEGAL?\\n\\nThe Israeli military while attacking Gaza with airstrikes and missiles, also blocked deliveries of food, water, fuel, electricity and other essentials, collectively punishing 2 million Palestinians in Gaza.\\n\\nUnited Nations human rights chief Volker Turk has already said that such a siege depriving civilians of goods required for survival is illegal under international humanitarian law.\\n\\nThe Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross has said the instruction for hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes, “coupled with the complete siege explicitly denying them food, water, and electricity, are not compatible with international humanitarian law.”\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch has accused Israel of using munitions containing white phosphorus. The incendiary substance is not banned, but its use in densely populated areas has been widely condemned.\\n\\nBoth Hamas and Israel have been “indiscriminately bombing each other” which also constitutes a war crime, as it is not just targeting military personnel, according to Melanie O’Brien, visiting professor in international law at the University of Minnesota.\\n\\nCAN LAWBREAKERS BE HELD TO ACCOUNT?\\n\\nThe International Criminal Court has the power to prosecute nations’ officials for violations and order compensation for victims. But some countries – including the United States, Russia and Israel — do not recognize the court’s jurisdiction, and the ICC does not have a police force to execute arrest warrants.\\n\\nWhile the ICC is the only permanent international tribunal set up to prosecute war crimes, other international courts including the International Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights can hear cases related to alleged violations.\\n\\nAmnesty International, which is also investigating Israeli attacks in Gaza, points to evidences of war crimes in Israeli attacks.\\n\\n“Our research points to damning evidence of war crimes in Israel’s bombing campaign that must be urgently investigated. Decades of impunity and injustice and the unprecedented level of death and destruction of the current offensive will only result in further violence and instability in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories,” Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General said.\\n\\nIn 2021, prosecutors at the ICC opened a formal investigation into the Palestinian territories, including alleged crimes by Israeli forces and by Hamas and Palestinian armed groups. Israel, which is not a member of the ICC, has refused to recognise its jurisdiction or cooperate with the probe, which covers possible crimes going back to the 2014 war in Gaza.\\n\\nThe court has said only that its mandate to investigate crimes going back to 2014 is ongoing and would also apply to any alleged crimes committed during the current war.\\n\\n(With inputs from agencies)',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'October 22, 2023 01:07 am | Updated 11:33 am IST\\n\\nWhen the state of Israel was declared in May 1948 in Palestine, five Arab countries attacked the newly created state, launching the first Arab-Israeli war. In the subsequent months, some 7,00,000 Arabs from Palestine, mostly from areas that became part of the Jewish state, were uprooted from their homes. Most of them took refuge in Gaza, a tiny Mediterranean strip of land, and the West Bank, the land on the western bank of the Jordan River. As refugees started flowing into Gaza, the 356 sq. km territory saw its population swelling to over 2,00,000 within months. In the war, Israel captured more Palestinian territories than what the UN partition plan had envisaged for a Jewish state. Jordan seized the West Bank and East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip fell into the hands of Egypt.\\n\\nAlso read: Will Israel’s Gaza offensive stop Hamas? | Explained\\n\\nThe people of Gaza, who lived under Ottoman rule for centuries and British occupation for decades subsequently, would continue to see their fate being determined by colonisers. Israel would capture the enclave in 1967 and keep it under its control, either through direct military occupation or blockades. Gaza has remained a flashpoint ever since, with occasional bouts of violence. The latest in this episode was the October 7 Sabbath attack by Hamas, the Islamist militants who control Gaza today, that killed at least 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians. In retaliation, Israel has launched a massive bombing campaign, already killing some 4,000 people, and is now preparing for a ground invasion.\\n\\nHistory of Gaza\\n\\nWhen Palestine was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, it was divided into six administrative districts. Gaza Sanjak (District of Gaza) was one of them, stretching from Jaffa in the north (now part of Israel) to Rafah (now, the border crossing with Egypt) in the south. For over four centuries, it remained an Ottoman district of Palestine.\\n\\nFrom the early 19th century, Jews, fleeing discrimination in Europe, had started migrating to Palestine. In 1917, during the last leg of the First World War, the British captured Palestine, including Gaza, from a crumbling Ottoman Empire. In the same year, the British had promised to support the creation of “a national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine. After the war, Palestine, comprising today’s Israel, West Bank and Gaza, became a British colony. Jewish migration to British-ruled Palestine would pick up pace during the interwar period. This would lead to Arab-Jewish violent riots in the 1930s.\\n\\nAlso read: Why did Hamas launch a surprise attack on Israel? | Analysis\\n\\nBy the time the Second World War was over, Jews had become a sizeable community in Palestine with a parallel administration, the Jewish Agency, and their own militia groups — Haganah and Irgun. Britain approached the UN, declaring its intent to vacate the mandate. The UN partition plan — divide Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state and an international city of Jerusalem—was rejected outright by the Arabs. In 1948, just before the British mandate ended, Zionists unilaterally declared the state of Israel, which triggered the 1948 war.\\n\\nUnder the Israeli occupation, there were two different streams of Palestinian movements—the secular nationalism championed by Fatah and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), and the Islamist awakening promoted by the Muslim Brotherhood. In Gaza, the Brothers had established deep roots. In both Palestinian territories (the West Bank, including East Jerusalem) and Gaza, public anger was building up against Israel’s occupation. And Gaza played a major part in the outbreak of the first intifada (uprising) against the occupation. On December 8, 1987, several Palestinians were killed in a traffic incident in Gaza, involving an Israeli driver, which immediately led to a wave of protests, which spread to the West Bank. The PLO called for a mass uprising. A year later, Hamas was established.\\n\\nThe intifada would eventually lead to the Oslo Accords of 1993 which saw a provisional authority (the Palestinian Authority) being formed with limited powers in certain parts of the West Bank and Gaza. But the real promise of the Oslo process was Palestinian statehood. That would collapse in the mid-1990s as Israel would accuse the Palestinians of reneging on the security promises they made and walk back from its own promises. Hamas, which opposed the Oslo Accords, would continue to carry out attacks against the Israelis during this period. Oslo Accord’s failure led to the second intifada in 2000. Both Gaza and the West Bank erupted in violence, and this time, Hamas was in the driving seat.\\n\\nFrom the 1970s, Israel had promoted Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. In 2005, faced with Hamas’s violent resistance, Israel unilaterally decided to pull back its troops and settlers from Gaza. For the first time in centuries, Palestinians got a chance to establish their own rule in the enclave, even though Israel’s direct occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem continued. In the first elections held in the Palestinian territories, in 2006, Hamas came to power, defeating Fatah. The Islamists and the secularists initially formed a unity government. But it would fall apart quickly, particularly after Western countries refused to sanction funds to the Palestinian Authority led by Hamas, which they see as a terrorist outfit. A brief Fatah-Hamas civil war would break out. Fatah ousted Hamas from the West Bank and the latter captured Gaza in 2007. Ever since, Hamas has been the government in Gaza.\\n\\nBut for Israel, Hamas, which it has designated as a terrorist outfit, taking over Gaza was a security challenge. Hamas did not see Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, which is only a part of Palestine, as an end of its conflict with Israel. It said it retained the right to resist as long as Israel continued the occupation of Palestinian territories. On the other side, Israel imposed a land, air and naval blockade on Gaza from 2007 onwards, to control what and who go in and out of the enclave. Constant tensions led to occasional wars. Since 2007, there have been four major conflicts between Israel and Hamas in which thousands of Palestinians and hundreds of Israelis were killed.\\n\\nLargest open prison\\n\\nGaza is often described as the world’s largest open prison. Its population has ballooned to 2.3 million, making it one of the most densely populated regions. Israel has built barriers along the border — both overland and underground — with limited checkpoints.It issues a limited number of permits to the Gazans to get out of the enclave. The unemployment rate in Gaza is roughly 47% (it is 70% among the young). Electricity is scarce — eight-hour power cuts are common. Israel has destroyed Gaza’s only airport and restrained access for the Gazans to the Mediterranean Sea. The enclave’s economy is mostly run on contributions from abroad.\\n\\nOver the years, Israel has built a security model based on keeping Palestine’s organised resistance under check using force, money, checkpoints, barriers and blockades. In the past, Israel had seen Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, another Islamist group operating from Gaza, launching rockets into Israel in protest against its highhandedness in the West Bank, including raids at the al Aqsa compound in East Jerusalem. But on October 7, Hamas launched an unexpected ground invasion into Israel — something which hasn’t happened since 1948. The attack from Gaza shattered Israel’s security model and brought the Palestine question, which has been sidelined by both Israel and Arab powers, back to the fore of West Asia. To rebuild its deterrence, Israel is now showering fire and fury on the whole of Gaza.',\n",

Daniel Hagari said the military has notified the families of 229 hostages that their loved ones are currently being held in the enclave.\\n\\nThe number does not include four released hostages — mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Ra’anan, who were freed a week ago, and elderly women Yocheved Lifshitz and Nurit Cooper, freed on Monday night.\\n\\nHagari said the number is not final as the military continues to investigate new information.\\n\\nHowever, a member of a Hamas delegation visiting Russia claimed that the terror group still does not know where all the people kidnapped by Palestinian terrorists during their attack are being held.\\n\\nThe Hamas official, named as Abu Hamid, claimed in an interview with Russia’s semi-official Kommersant news outlet that the terror group has always been willing to release civilians, but “needs time to find them.” He additionally claimed members of various groups are holding hostages, and that a ceasefire was needed to allow Hamas to carry out its search, find the hostages and then release them.\\n\\nThe updated hostage figures from the military came after Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday promised to make “every effort” to return the hostages as he reiterated that a ground operation was looming and vowed to win the war, asserting that the country’s next 75 years largely depend on it.\\n\\nIn a primetime televised address, the defense minister said: “We are in decisive moments. This is a war for our home and we will win it. It’s either us or them.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGallant said again that the planned ground offensive will occur soon. “Additional stages in the war will also come, we are creating the conditions for them and we will carry them out. I am determined… to ensure the State of Israel is victorious over this tough and evil enemy — over this epitome of evil.”\\n\\n“Nothing like this has happened in Israel’s 75 years of existence,” he continued, referring to the scale of the carnage and destruction, and the number of abducted Israelis. “What will happen in the next 75 years depends largely on the achievements in this battle.”\\n\\nOn Wednesday, The New York Times reported that Israel had agreed to a request from the United States to temporarily delay the planned Gaza ground incursion to give Washington more time to deploy additional air defense systems to protect its troops in the region.\\n\\nThe US was also reportedly concerned that Israel lacks achievable military goals for its operations in Gaza, leading to fears that the IDF is not yet ready for a ground incursion.\\n\\nThe campaign is also understood to have been postponed to allow for extensive internationally brokered negotiations with Hamas over the potential release of hundreds of Israeli and foreign hostages it is holding.\\n\\nThe negotiations have also resulted in a trickle of humanitarian aid entering Gaza for its besieged and devastated civilian population.\\n\\nLed by Hamas and carried out with other terror groups, the October 7 assault saw some 2,500 terrorists burst across the border into Israel from the Gaza Strip by land, air and sea, killing some 1,400 people and seizing more than 230 hostages of all ages, under the cover of thousands of rockets fired at Israeli towns and cities.\\n\\nIsrael says its war against Hamas is aimed at destroying the Iran-backed terror group’s infrastructure and has vowed to dismantle the organization after the massacres while minimizing harm to Gaza’s civilians. The IDF has been calling on Palestinians to evacuate from northern Gaza southward, as it intensifies strikes in the Gaza City area.\\n\\nAn airstrike on Thursday killed the deputy head of Hamas’s intelligence directorate, Shadi Barud, the military said.\\n\\nThe IDF accused Barud of planning the October 7 massacre along with Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. Barud previously served as a battalion commander in the Khan Younis area and held other roles in the terror group’s intelligence directorate, and “was responsible for planning numerous terror attacks against Israeli civilians,” the IDF said.\\n\\nAnother strike killed the head of Hamas’s North Khan Younis rocket array, Hassan al-Abdullah, according to the army, which added that fighter jets had struck and killed several more Hamas members and destroyed several sites belonging to the terror group throughout the day.\\n\\nAnd in the evening, the military said it had killed three senior commanders in Hamas’s Daraj-Tuffah Battalion: the battalion’s commander, Rifaat Abbas; the deputy commander, Ibrahim Jadba; and a combat support commander, Tarek Maarouf. According to the IDF, the Daraj-Tuffah Battalion is part of Hamas’s Gaza City Brigade, which is “considered the most significant brigade of the Hamas terrorist organization.”\\n\\nIsraeli Air Force sources say that more than 10,000 sites belonging to Hamas and other terror groups have been struck since the beginning of the war.\\n\\nGaza’s Hamas-run health ministry says the strikes have killed over 7,000 people, many of them children. The figures issued by the terror group cannot be independently verified, and are believed to include its own terrorists and gunmen killed in Israel and in Gaza, and the victims of what Israel says are hundreds of errant Palestinian rockets that have landed in the Strip since the war began. Israel says it killed 1,500 Hamas terrorists inside Israel on and after October 7.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Hamas released a list of almost 7,000 names of people it said had been killed in Israeli strikes, after US President Joe Biden cast doubt on the toll issued by the terror group-controlled Gaza health ministry. That list too could not be independently verified.\\n\\nThe death toll on both sides is expected to rise significantly once Israel launches its ground offensive and begins entering Gazan cities. Troops are expected to have to contend with Gaza’s network of tunnels dug by terror groups, booby traps and bombs, as they battle through tough urban environments.\\n\\nFriday also additional barrages of rocket fire from Gaza toward central and southern Israel.\\n\\nOne rocket struck the top two floors of an apartment building in Tel Aviv, injuring four people. Each of them was evacuated to nearby hospitals — two men, 53 and 20, were moderately wounded from shrapnel and two men, 78 and 52, were lightly wounded from smoke inhalation.\\n\\nThe Hamas’s al-Qassam Brigades claimed responsibility for the barrages, saying in a statement that they were “in response to Zionist massacres against civilians,” it said.\\n\\nFootage shows the moment of the rocket impact in Tel Aviv pic.twitter.com/BnyWYeDRgd — Emanuel (Mannie) Fabian (@manniefabian) October 27, 2023\\n\\nThursday also saw multiple salvos of rockets aimed at central Israel, including the cities of Tel Aviv, Rishon Lezion, Bat Yam, Givatayim, Ramat Gan, Holon and others, as well as barrages targeting southern cities Ashdod, Ashkelon and Netivot, as well as Gaza border towns.\\n\\nRocket launched from Gaza hits an apartment building in Tel Aviv: 3 injured pic.twitter.com/vIIVGQIrDU — Amichai Stein (@AmichaiStein1) October 27, 2023\\n\\nGazan terrorists have launched thousands of rockets at Israel since October 7, killing and wounding dozens, and sending hundreds of thousands running for shelter, and the education of hundreds of thousands of children disrupted as schools remain shut or in a limited format.\\n\\nMichael Bachner, Times of Israel staff and agencies contributed to this report.',\n",

Choose your plan ArrowRight In the grim aftermath of Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, a slogan spread. “Hamas is ISIS,” declared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, linking the grotesque slaughter carried out by the Palestinian faction’s militants to the ravages of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria almost a decade prior. The latter — driven by an apocalyptic, millenarian creed — had embarked on a frenzy of killing, torture, grisly execution and abductions of civilians from communities of supposed apostates and enemies. The reports of what Hamas fighters did across towns and kibbutzim in southern Israel recalled the cruelty and savagery of the Islamic State’s rampage.\\n\\nAnd, in the Israeli view, it merited an equivalent response. “Just as the forces of civilization united to defeat ISIS, the forces of civilization must support Israel in defeating Hamas,” Netanyahu said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe refrain became a hashtag, and has been echoed by Israeli officials and politicians across the spectrum, as well as by Israel’s allies. A week after the massacres, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin described what Hamas did as “worse than ISIS.” On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron appeared alongside Netanyahu and took the analogy further, suggesting that an international coalition the likes of which fought al-Qaeda and the Islamic State should now defeat Israel’s quarry. He said that Israel was not alone and that “France is ready for the coalition, which is fighting in Iraq and Syria against ISIS, to also fight against Hamas.”\\n\\nWhat that means in practice is still unclear. Israel is preparing for the next phase of its offensive against Hamas, which Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said on Tuesday “must be erased off the face of the planet.” Relentless Israeli bombardments of the besieged Gaza Strip killed 5,791 Palestinians and compounded an already devastating humanitarian crisis. Meanwhile, the United States has rushed aid and military assets to the region. Along with European allies, the Biden administration is attempting to tamp down the possibility of the conflict turning into Middle East conflagration.\\n\\nGiven the scale and horror of Hamas’s carnage, the invocation of ISIS is not surprising. Oct. 7 marked the single bloodiest day in Israeli history, and the bloodiest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust. More than two weeks later, journalists are still learning more grisly details from Israeli authorities of how Hamas militants butchered toddlers and babies, raped women and incinerated terrified civilians in their homes. Israeli officials have vowed a merciless campaign of retribution against “human animals” and framed their actions, which have led to soaring Palestinian civilian death tolls, in the same moral light as battles against Nazis, let alone the global campaign to defeat the Islamic State.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBut scholars of the Middle East contend that such rhetoric deliberately flattens the deep forces at play. Saying there’s no distinction between Hamas and the Islamic State is “an effective tactic to paint it — and all Gazans, given many Israeli leaders’ generalizing language — as inhuman, irredeemably evil and therefore legitimate targets for savagery in reprisal,” argued Monica Marks, a professor of Middle East politics at New York University’s Abu Dhabi campus. She added that Hamas’s Islamist character and theological convictions were arguably less important than its self-styled vision of being the armed standard-bearer of Palestinian national liberation.\\n\\nShare this article Share\\n\\nItzchak Weismann, an Israeli historian of Islamist movements at the University of Haifa, concurred. “There’s a tendency to say that [Hamas] was always ISIS. But that’s not necessarily true. It’s an organization that responds to the situation,” he told Israeli newspaper Haaretz last week, pointing to how Hamas has tolerated other religious groups in Gaza. “Hamas tried to be inclusive of all of Gaza’s population. ... In contrast, ISIS would murder any Muslim who didn’t pray at the correct time. You can’t just say, ‘ISIS slaughtered people and so did Hamas, so they’re the same.’ That’s very superficial.”\\n\\nThere’s also the small wrinkle, noted Aaron Zelin, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, that ISIS “literally views Hamas as apostates” because of its ties to the Shiite theocratic regime in Iran.\\n\\nIsrael’s desire to wholly eliminate Hamas may be understandable, but analysts query whether it’s actually possible. It would require a brutal ground war even more fraught and complicated than the effort to drive ISIS out of its redoubts in Iraq and Syria. Though chased from their so-called “caliphate,” their ideology has hardly been expunged and ISIS offshoots proliferate in various parts of the world.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAndrew Exum, a former senior Pentagon official in the Obama administration who helped craft the anti-ISIS strategy, warned of the hideous toll exacted on civilians as coalition forces recaptured the Islamic State’s main strongholds of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. “The human costs of recapturing Raqqa and Mosul were staggering,” Exum wrote, adding that, “like Gaza, too, Raqqa and Mosul are large urban areas: Avoiding large-scale civilian casualties was impossible.”\\n\\nAnd even if Hamas is crushed and shorn of its ability to threaten Israel with the horrific violence it unleashed on Oct. 7, it won’t address the context from which Hamas emerged and has since operated. That includes, as U.N. Secretary General António Guterres observed at the Security Council on Tuesday, more than five decades of Israeli military occupation of Palestinian territories, the predations of an Israeli settlement project emboldened by the far-right government of Netanyahu, and the collapse of any political process to reckon with the absence of a Palestinian state or Palestinian political rights within Israel.\\n\\n“For all of Israel’s efforts to paint it as the Palestinian branch of the Islamic State, and as reactionary and violent as it is, Hamas is an Islamic nationalist organization, not a nihilist cult, and a part of Palestinian political society; it feeds on the despair produced by the occupation, and cannot simply be liquidated any more than the fascist zealots in Netanyahu’s cabinet,” wrote Jewish American author and critic Adam Shatz, in an essay in the London Review of Books.',\n",

Injured people lie on the hospital floors, medical tents and mattresses holding patients occupy the space outside the building, while dead bodies continue to arrive at the facility.\\n\\nThousands of displaced Palestinians have taken refuge here, squeezing themselves in corridors and waiting rooms. Meanwhile, many patients with chronic diseases who were being treated at hospitals in the north of the besieged enclave are now at Al Aqsa Martyrs, having fled their homes after evacuation orders from the Israeli military.\\n\\nFor kidney patients, dialysis treatment is a matter of life and death.\\n\\nBefore the latest Israeli offensive began on October 7, the hospital had 143 patients requiring dialysis. Now, the number of patients has more than doubled to about 300, including 11 children who all have just 24 dialysis machines between them.\\n\\nIyad Issa Abu Zaher, the hospital’s director general, said the facility is overwhelmed.\\n\\n“We have resorted to rationing of all resources and medical supplies,” he told Al Jazeera. “A kidney dialysis patient now undergoes treatment once or twice a week for an hour or two, but before they used to come in three times a week.”\\n\\nEven before the war, Gaza’s health ministry had warned that the lives of 1,100 kidney failure patients, including 38 children, were at risk due to a lack of fuel and an acute shortage of the necessary medical supplies needed for dialysis.\\n\\nLast month, Alaa Helles, the director of the Hospital Pharmacy Department at Gaza’s Ministry of Health, said the territory’s hospitals provided 13,000 dialysis sessions every month.\\n\\nThis requires more than 13,000 filters, 13,000 blood collection tubes and 26,000 blood cannulas per month, but since Israel and Egypt control the territory’s border crossings, even before the war patients were often left to wonder whether there would be enough supplies to treat them.\\n\\nThe Gaza Strip has been under an Israeli blockade for 16 years with the movement of goods severely curtailed by Israel and Egypt. The blockade has only tightened since October 7, following an attack by the armed wing of the Palestinian group Hamas in southern Israel. So far, only several dozen aid trucks have been allowed in – a “drop in the ocean” in terms of the aid needed. Before the war, some 450 trucks entered daily with supplies.\\n\\nBreaking point\\n\\nAbu Zaher said the Gaza Strip’s healthcare system has reached a breaking point, echoing the health ministry’s statement on Tuesday regarding the remaining operating hospitals.\\n\\nAlready, 12 hospitals and 32 health centres have been forced to stop functioning, the ministry statement said. “And we fear that more will stop due to the Israeli targeting and the lack of fuel,” it added.\\n\\nBut keeping the doors of the remaining hospitals in the Gaza Strip open does not in itself mean these facilities are able to treat the wounded who flock to them, the statement said, saying that many medicines and medical supplies have already run out in hospitals.\\n\\nAbu Zaher said that without fuel, patients in operating rooms, intensive care units, babies being kept alive in incubators and others who rely on lifesaving machines are all at risk.\\n\\n“Patients are stacked outside operating rooms as we don’t have enough beds,” he said. Meanwhile, others recovering after operations have been moved to the outdoor tents – “a field hospital of sorts,” he explained.\\n\\nBut Abu Zaher also stressed that recovery for patients who have been treated is not guaranteed given that the overcrowded environment and lack of medical supplies can lead to serious infections.\\n\\n“The outbreak of disease is inevitable,” he said. “There will be a humanitarian disaster after the war ends.”\\n\\n‘Exhausted from this reality’\\n\\nManar Shreir from the Zeitoun neighbourhood in Gaza City used to go to the Al-Quds Hospital for kidney dialysis.\\n\\nShe and her family fled the intense Israeli bombardment of the city and made their way to Deir el-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, where her sister lives, after the Israeli military ordered 1.1 million Palestinians from the north to evacuate to the south.\\n\\nThe Al-Quds Hospital also received warnings from the Israeli military to evacuate, indicating that it could be targeted, the Palestinian Red Crescent has said. The hospital’s director responded to the Israeli military saying a large-scale evacuation would be possible only if Israel provided buses to transport the 12,000 people taking shelter at Al-Quds – including patients – to the southern Gaza Strip and ensured a safe space for them there. The Israeli official reportedly hung up.\\n\\nBut even those like Shreir, who have managed to make it to the south, face a struggle to get treatment.\\n\\n“My sister’s house [in Deir el-Balah] is close to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, but I still have to queue for hours since the early morning, just waiting [for] my turn,” said Shreir as she sits up in a hospital bed with a red blanket around her legs.\\n\\nShreir has been on dialysis since 2015, going to the hospital three times a week for four-hour sessions. Now, she is lucky if she can get dialysis twice a week, for up to two and a half hours per session.\\n\\n“It’s a huge difference,” she said. “The session is barely enough to get the toxins and accumulated fluids out of my blood. I have to watch what I eat and drink, and I barely let water pass my lips because I don’t want to have shortness of breath or swelling.”\\n\\nAfter her last treatment, Shreir was on her way back to her sister’s house when Israeli air attacks hit the street parallel to the one she was on.\\n\\n“It’s terrifying,” she said. “Even when you are in the hospital you’re scared. Windows have shattered before, the destruction is all around you, not to mention the horrific sound of the bombs. Inside, it’s not any better, with bodies of people killed piled up, blood on the floor, people missing limbs.\\n\\n“We are exhausted from this reality. Enough criminality, enough war.”\\n\\n‘Not enough’\\n\\nHajj Salah al-Din Ahmed Suleiman Abu Iyadeh, 61, a displaced patient from Gaza City receiving dialysis at Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, said that without regular treatment, patients will suffer from severe fatigue and swelling.\\n\\n“Dialysis that is two and a half hours once or twice a week is not enough,” he said.\\n\\n“These are toxins in the body which can’t be allowed to stay. Right now, we are making do, but if this war continues, there will be serious problems due to the capacity and immense pressure the hospital is under.”\\n\\nAccording to the health ministry, Israeli air attacks have killed 5,791 Palestinians in 18 days, including 2,360 children and 1,292 women. More than 16,000 others have been wounded.\\n\\nAbout 1,500 people are trapped under rubble, including 830 children, according to the health ministry.\\n\\nThe Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital alone has received 2,850 injured people and the bodies of almost 1,000 Palestinians, Abu Zaher said.\\n\\n“Most of the casualties are men, women and children who were killed inside their own homes after an Israeli air raid targeted their building,” he said.\\n\\nStaff at the hospital work under constant, tremendous pressure due to the overwhelming health situation as well as their personal circumstances.\\n\\n“Some of our staff have received news that their families were targeted or killed in Israeli air attacks,” he said. “No hospital in the world operates like this.”',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Analysis: Amid Israel\\'s ongoing bombardment of Gaza, right-wing and Hindu nationalist accounts in India have surfaced on social media amplifying anti-Palestinian and Islamophobic disinformation.\\n\\nIn the wake of Israel\\'s war on Gaza, brought about by the unexpected attack by Hamas on the 7th of October, a curious trend has emerged on social media.\\n\\nIn the past two weeks, Indian right-wing accounts - many of which depict the Indian flag side by side with the Israeli one - have voiced some of the most staunch support for Israel online, and are among the leading producers and amplifiers of anti-Palestine disinformation.\\n\\nThese pro-Israel advocates also make their presence felt on the streets of India, where rallies are organised in support of Israel, expressing unwavering support even in the face of controversial events such as the Al Ahli Hospital bombing, the deadliest attack of this war, which killed over 470 Palestinians.\\n\\nRight-leaning accounts in India have attributed the strike to Hamas rather than Israel, despite evidence pointing to Israel\\'s responsibility.\\n\\nIndia\\'s Prime Minister Narendra Modi was one of the first leaders to express support for Israel on 7 October, stating, \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families. We stand in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour\".\\n\\n\"Experts have observed that right-leaning Indian accounts are significantly boosting the Israeli narrative to South Asian audiences, a demographic not easily reached by Western media\"\\n\\nIn Israel’s war on Gaza, there has been a surge of disinformation and fake news on social media, amplified by platforms like X (formerly Twitter), particularly focused on spreading anti-Palestinian and Islamophobic claims.\\n\\nExperts have observed that right-leaning Indian accounts are significantly boosting the Israeli narrative to South Asian audiences, a demographic not easily reached by Western media.\\n\\nThis phenomenon could have real-life implications for India’s Muslim community, with violent Islamophobic sentiment already widespread.\\n\\n“Whereas support for Israel online has been on a mass scale, there have been only pockets of support for Palestinians,\" Azad Essa, journalist and author of Hostile Homelands: The New Alliance Between India and Israel, told The New Arab.\\n\\n\"Many Muslims in India have told me there is a lot of fear that should they come out on the streets en masse, it would be used as another excuse to label them ‘terrorists’ or make them targeted on the streets. So there is a lot of helplessness.”\\n\\nA unique bromance\\n\\nIn India, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has forged strong connections with Israel, both on the political and social levels.\\n\\nEssa explained that Hindutva, the ideology and movement of Hindu nationalism, shares Israel\\'s approach to confronting \\'terrorists’ - referring to the perception of Muslims in both countries.\\n\\nIsrael has even supported India in its past conflicts with Pakistan by providing mortars, ammunition, and advanced laser-guided missiles. India is the largest buyer of Israeli-made arms, splurging over $1 billion annually.\\n\\nIn 2017, Prime Minister Modi made history by becoming the first Indian PM to journey to Israel. During the visit, he stated that both countries share a \"deep, centuries-old connection,\" thus ushering in a robust political alliance paired with military and cyber security agreements.\\n\\n\"Hindutva and Zionism both share a similar expansionist nature,\" Essa remarked. \"India considers all of south Asia Hindu, while Israel dreams of a Greater Israel extending beyond its present borders.”\\n\\nIn addition to spreading online disinformation, supporters of India\\'s ruling BJP party have taken to the streets in support of Israel\\'s war against Gaza. [Getty]\\n\\nIn both these nations, certain faiths enjoy more privileges than others, with Hindus and Jews wielding more rights than any minority.\\n\\nIslamophobia has been on the rise since the ascent of Modi\\'s BJP. A report from the Australia-based Islamic Council of Victoria revealed that the majority of Islamophobic tweets on X originate from India.\\n\\n“The binding force of these nationalist ideologies lies in Islamophobia and the drive to put Muslims in their place,” Essa added, explaining that for India, Israel serves as a model for governance.\\n\\n“India aspires to be like Israel, envisioning itself as a first-world, advanced liberal democracy, similar to Israel, which, as we know, is not an actual democracy,\" said Essa.\\n\\nEssa explained that Hindu nationalists dream of replicating the Israeli apartheid system against Palestinians, and this is reflected in endless vilification online.\\n\\n\"In some ways, apartheid is well underway in India,\" he noted.\\n\\n\"India is the most populous country in the world with many Internet users, especially English-speaking users, so the mobilisation of Indian influencers or disinfluencers promoting disinformation is really significant\"\\n\\nSocial media wars\\n\\nIn many cases, anti-Muslim and Islamophobic sentiments are tools used by populist leaders to gain popularity by exacerbating social conflicts and pitting one group against another, explained Associate Professor of Middle East Studies at Hamad bin Khalifa University and disinformation researcher Marc Owen Jones.\\n\\n\"This could be deliberate to drive popularity for Modi. It could be a political strategy designed to rally his base,\" Jones told The New Arab, explaining that India\\'s digital media power and influence on people\\'s perceptions of world events should not to be underestimated.\\n\\n\"India is the most populous country in the world with many Internet users, especially English-speaking users, so the mobilisation of Indian influencers or disinfluencers promoting disinformation is really significant,\" Jones said.\\n\\n\"If you look at the most popular Tweets (posts on X) about Israel and Palestine, the majority are from Indian journalists who tend to support Israel and misrepresent Palestine,\" he added.\\n\\nFurthermore, the BJP\\'s IT Cell - the department that manages social media campaigns - plays a key role. According to Swati Chaturvedi\\'s \"I Am a Troll\" book, volunteers are hired to follow instructions from the social media cell and its affiliated organisations to share propaganda.\\n\\n“The amount of disinformation is staggering this time,\" Essa remarked. “Thousands of Indian right-wing accounts are bolstering Israeli propaganda and helping Israel reach South Asian audiences.\"\\n\\nEssa points out that these false narratives serve a dual purpose, not only portraying Palestinians as stereotypical terrorists but also as predators against women.\\n\\n“Both Zionism and Hindutva share a common fear of being outnumbered by Muslims, which strengthens the case for nationalism. Anyone daring to oppose these ideologies is labelled as anti-nationalist,” Essa said.\\n\\n“It\\'s increasingly challenging to discuss Palestine in India.”\\n\\nRELATED Does Israel have an endgame in Gaza? Analysis\\n\\nPaid to spread fake news\\n\\nOne individual actively working to debunk misinformation and counter Israeli propaganda while amplifying Palestinian voices is Mohammed Zubair, an Indian journalist and co-founder of Alt News, an Indian nonprofit fact-checking website.\\n\\nZubair has faced backlash from official accounts, including the Consul General of Israel to Midwest India, Kbbi Shoshani, who urged him to “Stop spreading fake news and hatred about Israel,\" in his post on X.\\n\\n\"People often fail to fact-check information and tend to use any piece of information to justify the attacks on Palestinian civilians,” Zubair told The New Arab.\\n\\nGiven that India has more WhatsApp users than social media users, Essa argues that most misinformation and disinformation originate from WhatsApp, particularly within large group chats.\\n\\nHowever, Zubair contends that X remains the primary platform for the spread of misinformation and disinformation: \"Numerous right-wing Indian influencers with substantial followings, some even followed by high-ranking officials such as Modi himself, play a pivotal role in disseminating Israeli propaganda\".\\n\\nThe spread of Islamophobic information online could have real life consequences for India\\'s Muslim community, which already faces severe persecution. [Getty]\\n\\nThese accounts intentionally share emotional content, even if it is false, so that they can attract a large audience, Zubair explained. Additionally, X\\'s current regulations permit these accounts - particularly subscribers to X Premium - with substantial followings and interactions to earn money, providing additional incentive to keep posting.\\n\\nDespite the availability of community notes, which allow audiences to explain facts beneath each post, some people remain unfazed and keep posting to generate revenue, Zubair added. By doing so, disinformation campaigns become lucrative businesses.\\n\\n\"\\'Prior to Elon Musk\\'s acquisition of the platform in 2022, accounts that posted inappropriate or false content would receive warnings before being suspended. Now, these accounts get amplified, especially if they have a blue checkmark,” Zubaied explained.\\n\\nDespite efforts from individuals speaking up for the Palestinian side, the pro-Israeli stance remains dominant among the public.\\n\\n\"Prior to Elon Musk\\'s acquisition of the platform in 2022, accounts that posted inappropriate or false content would receive warnings before being suspended.

If you missed the October, 20, 2023 UPSC CSE exam key from the Indian Express, read it here\\n\\nFRONT PAGE\\n\\nOne-nation, one-poll: EC says it needs up to a year’s ‘lead time’ for EVMs, VVPATs\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Indian Polity and Governance\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMains Examination: General Studies II: Salient features of the Representation of People’s Act.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story- Even as the Law Commission is now close to finalising its report on the conduct of simultaneous polls, the Election Commission (EC), in its meeting with members of the law panel earlier this year, is learnt to have underlined the need for a “definite lead time” of up to a year before implementation, citing “steep” logistical challenges in manufacturing voting machines.\\n\\n• What Election Commission said regarding “one nation, one poll”?\\n\\n• What the Law Commission, headed by Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi, former Chief Justice of the Karnataka High Court said regarding the “one nation, one poll”?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• What are the issues and concerns flagged by the Election Commission (EC)?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• What is the significance of semiconductors and chips in the context of simultaneous elections?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• For Your Information-Sources told The Indian Express that in its feedback to the law panel earlier this year regarding the feasibility of conducting simultaneous polls, the EC flagged concerns about the global shortage of semiconductors and chips, which is an essential component for manufacturing Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) & Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (or VVPAT) machines. This shortage posed significant challenges in meeting the EC’s additional voting machine requirements (about 4 lakh) for just the Lok Sabha polls in 2024, not taking into account the additional number required for conducting all elections together.\\n\\n“They (EC) felt that a definite lead time of up to a year would be required for ramping up the voting machine production lines, keeping in view the current commitments of the two manufacturers (Bharat Electronic Ltd. and Electronics Corporation of India Ltd). Moreover, the shortage of semiconductors, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, has further messed up the timelines for EVM procurement,” said a source who did not want to be identified.\\n\\nThe EC has never opposed the idea of holding simultaneous elections, as long as the logistical arrangements for EVM procurement are addressed, there is consensus among political parties, and there are corresponding amendments to the Constitution. The poll panel, however, wants six months to a year to prepare for it.\\n\\nThis isn’t the first time the EC has raised concerns about production challenges related to the semiconductor shortage. Earlier this year, in its submission to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law, and Justice, the poll panel attributed its inability to spend over 80 per cent of the budget allocated for procuring EVMs in 2022-2023, till January 31, to the global shortage of semiconductors, which resulted in delays in the machine manufacturing process.\\n\\nThe EC is firmly against roping in private manufacturers to increase production capacity, fearing potential damage to the credibility of the electoral process and public faith.\\n\\nThe EC has provided estimates to the Law Commission on the additional number of EVMs and VVPAT machines it would require if assembly and Lok Sabha polls are held simultaneously in 2024 and 2029. A voting machine essentially consists of three parts: a control unit, a ballot unit, and a VVPAT. For 2024, an additional 11.49 lakh control units (which initiate the voting process), 15.97 lakh ballot units (on which voters casts their vote), and 12.37 lakh VVPATs (which produce a printout post-voting to verify the voter’s choice) will be needed, with an additional cost of approximately Rs 5,200 crore.\\n\\nIf elections were to be held simultaneously in 2029, the EC would require a total of 53.76 lakh ballot units, 38.67 lakh control units, and 41.65 lakh VVPATs. The anticipated shortfall is 26.55 lakh ballot units, 17.78 lakh control units and 17.79 lakh VVPATs, for which the government would need to allocate close to Rs 8,000 crore. The increased demand for voting machines and VVPATs in 2029 is due to the growing number of voters and polling stations. The latter is expected to increase from 11.8 lakh in 2024 to 13.57 lakh in 2029.\\n\\n• Know about Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT)\\n\\n• What are Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs)?\\n\\n• What are Voter-Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT)?\\n\\n• Do You Know- EVM or Electronic Voting Machines are used to cast vote without revealing your identity. It is used in Indian General and State Elections. It has replaced paper ballots in local, state and general (parliamentary) elections in India.\\n\\nEVM has two parts, it consists of a ‘control unit’ and a ‘balloting unit’, connected by a 5-metre cable. The control unit is with the Election Commission-appointed polling officer; the balloting unit is in the voting compartment into which the voter enters to cast the vote in secret by pressing the button against the name and symbol of the candidate of her choice. The control unit is the EVM’s ‘brain’ — the balloting unit is turned on only after the polling officer presses the ‘Ballot’ button on it. The EVM runs on a 6 volt single alkaline battery fitted in the control unit, and can even be used in areas that have no electricity. The use of EVM started back in 1982 Kerala Assembly elections. Prior to this only ballot papers and ballot boxes were allowed. There are only two Indian PSUs that manufacture EVM machines. Bharat Electronic Limited (BEL) being the first and Electronics Corporation of Indian Limited (ECIL) the other. The secret source code is only accessible to a few engineers. Engineers who are in the factory have no clue about the constituency wise deployment of the machine.\\n\\nVoter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) machines are used during election process to verify that the vote polled by a voter goes to the correct candidate. VVPATs are a second line of verification and are particularly useful in the time when allegations around Electronic Voting Machines’ tampering crop up. Parties have been making regular demands for VVPATs to be used during elections after alleging EVMs may not be completely secure and tamper proof.\\n\\nVVPAT system gives instant feedback to the voter showing that the vote polled has in fact been allotted against the candidate chosen. After a voter presses the button on the EVM against the chosen candidate, the VVPAT prints a slip containing name of the candidate and the election symbol and drops it automatically into a sealed box. The machines give the chance for the voter to verify their vote. The machine is placed in a glass case in a way that only the voter can see it. The slip is displayed to the voter for seven seconds after which the VVPAT machine cuts it and drops in into the storage box with a beep. The machines can be accessed, though, by the polling officials and not by the voter.\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍The 360° UPSC Debate | Does India Need Simultaneous Elections?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIndia sought diplomatic parity due to Canada’s interference: Jaishankar\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance.\\n\\nMains Examination: General Studies II: Bilateral, regional and global groupings and agreements involving India and/or affecting India’s interests.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story-Days after Canada announced the withdrawal of 41 diplomats from India, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Sunday that India invoked diplomatic parity due to concerns over “continuous interference” in its “internal affairs” by Canadian personnel.\\n\\n• Why India-Canada relationship is going through “a difficult phase”?\\n\\n• “India invoked diplomatic parity due to concerns over “continuous interference” in its “internal affairs” by Canadian personnel”-What you understand by the term diplomatic parity?\\n\\n• What exactly MEA said?\\n\\n• “Parity is very much provided for by the Vienna Convention, which is the relevant international rule on this”-What is Vienna Convention?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• “Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called India’s actions as violation of Geneva convention”-What is Geneva convention?\\n\\n• For Your Information-The term “Vienna Convention” can refer to any of a number of treaties signed in Vienna, most of which are related to the harmonisation or formalisation of the procedures of international diplomacy. The treaty being referred to by the MEA in this instance is the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961), which “provides a complete framework for the establishment, maintenance and termination of diplomatic relations on a basis of consent between independent sovereign States”, as per an introductory note on the treaty in UN’s Audiovisual Library of International Law. Most notably, the Convention codifies the longstanding custom of diplomatic immunity, in which diplomatic missions are granted privileges that enable diplomats to perform their functions without fear of coercion or harassment by the host country. It affirms the concept of “inviolability” of a diplomatic mission, which has been one of the enduring cornerstones of international diplomacy. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations entered into force on April 24, 1964 and is nearly universally ratified, with Palau and South Sudan being the exceptions.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and Vienna Convention on Consular Relations-Know in detail\\n\\n• What does the Vienna Convention say about obligations of a “receiving State”?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n• For Your Information-In a statement Friday, the MEA said, “The state of our bilateral relations, the much higher number of Canadian diplomats in India, and their continued interference in our internal affairs warrant a parity in mutual diplomatic presence in New Delhi and Ottawa.” It said they have been “engaged with the Canadian side on this over the last month in order to work out the details and modalities of its implementation”.\\n\\nThe MEA said its actions in implementing parity were fully consistent with Article 11.1 of the Vienna Convention. It cited the convention on diplomatic relations: “In the absence of specific agreement as to the size of the mission, the receiving State may require that the size of a mission be kept within limits considered by it to be reasonable and normal, having regard to circumstances and conditions in the receiving State and to the needs of the particular mission.”\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍VIENNA CONVENTION\\n\\n📍Canada recalls 41 diplomats, Trudeau says India making life hard for millions\\n\\nCan be more patient to bring down inflation to 4%: RBI panel member\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Economic and Social Development\\n\\nMains Examination: General Studies III: Indian Economy and issues relating to planning, mobilization, of resources, growth, development and employment.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story– RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee member Jayanth R Varma is of the view that there is a need to be more patient when it comes to gliding inflation to the 4 per cent target, and this is the price to pay for avoiding a growth shock.\\n\\n• “Price stability and financial stability complement each other”-Analyse\\n\\n• With retail inflation at 5 per cent now and an environment of greater economic stability, how fast should the Reserve Bank of India go in reining in inflation?\\n\\n• “There’s also difference of opinion on withdrawal of accommodation, or loose monetary policy with higher liquidity in the system”-What is that?\\n\\n• Food inflation being increasingly driven by two items-Which are those items?\\n\\n• What happens when inflation goes up?\\n\\n• Inflation and Purchasing power-connect the dots\\n\\n• But food inflation is not new?\\n\\n• Why food inflation appear to be hurting people’s pockets more this time?\\n\\n• How does food inflation affect the average Indian consumer’s cost of living?\\n\\n• How policy makers deal with this situation?\\n\\n• What factor distinguishes Indian inflation from many other developed countries?\\n\\n• What is Inflation?\\n\\n• Know the Types of Inflation like Moderate Inflation, Galloping Inflation, Hyper-Inflation, Stagflation, Deflation, Core Inflation etc.\\n\\n• What are the causes of Inflation in the present situation\\n\\n• How Inflation is Measured in India?\\n\\n• What is the Long term, Medium Term and Short-term impact of Inflation?\\n\\n• New Standard for Measuring Inflation in India and Old Standard for Measuring Inflation-Key Differences\\n\\n• Steps or Measures Taken by GOI to Control Inflation\\n\\n• What do you understand by Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index?

This sums up the much-awaited verdict in the marriage equality matter — Supriya Chakraborty v Union of India. Forget the recognition of marriages for sexual minorities or civil unions of queer people, it appears that even others seem to have lost the fundamental right to marry in heterosexual marriages.\\n\\n• Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court unanimously rejected to grant legal recognition to same-sex marriage-What exactly Supreme Court Said in Supriya Chakraborty v Union of India?\\n\\n• “Despite dissenting opinions articulated by the Chief Justice of India and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who accorded recognition to the right to establish unions and jointly undertake adoption, the bench was surprisingly unequivocal in asserting that there is no fundamental right to marriage under the Indian Constitution”-Discuss\\n\\n• “After months of anticipation, the pronouncement is a profound letdown for the LGBTQIA+ community and constitutional law teachers”-Why?\\n\\n• “The decision appears to have succumbed to the prevailing ethos of majoritarian morality rather than oft-repeated “constitutional morality”-Do you agree with the same?\\n\\n• majoritarian morality vs constitutional morality-compare\\n\\n• Could you provide further instances in which judicial rulings have yielded to the dominant ethos of majority morality rather than adhering to constitutional morality?\\n\\n• Do you agree with the authors that the judgment become a classic case of judicial restraint?\\n\\n• What “institutional limitations” Supreme Court cited in its verdict?\\n\\n• Supreme Court’s Verdict-The bench was unanimous that marriage is a statutory right and not a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution and, hence, a subject matter for the Parliament and state legislatures.\\n\\n“This Court cannot either strike down the Constitutional validity of SMA or read words into the SMA because of its institutional limitations. This Court cannot read words into the provisions of the SMA and provisions of other allied laws such as the ISA (Indian Succession Act) and the HSA (Hindu Succession Act) because that would amount to judicial legislation. The Court, in the exercise of the power of judicial review, must steer clear of matters, particularly those impinging on policy, which fall in the legislative domain,” the CJI said, a view that other judges agreed with.\\n\\nIn the four separate judgments – by the CJI, Justice Kaul, Justice Bhat and Justice Narasimha – there was agreement in the bench that “queerness is a natural phenomenon” and “is not urban or elite”, that “there exists no fundamental right to marry under the Constitution… that the Special Marriage Act, 1954 (SMA), is neither unconstitutional nor can it be interpreted in such a manner so as to enable marriage between queer persons; and that… transgender persons in heterosexual relationships, have the right to solemnize marriage under existing legal frameworks”.\\n\\nAccording to CJI, “in pursuance of the power conferred by Articles 245 and 246 read with Entry 5 of the Concurrent List, Parliament has enacted laws creating and regulating the socio-legal institution of marriage. The State legislatures have made amendments to such laws with the assent of the President since the subject of marriage is in the Concurrent List. The petitioners seek that the Court recognise the right to marry as a fundamental right. As explained above, this would mean that even if Parliament and the State legislatures have not created an institution of marriage in exercise of their powers under Entry 5 of the Concurrent List, they would be obligated to create an institution because of the positive postulate encompassed in the right to marry. This argument cannot be accepted.”\\n\\nThough it concluded that there is no fundamental right to marry, the CJI’s ruling said “there is a right or freedom to enter into a union” as laid down in various judgments of the court – Navtej Johar, K S Puttaswamy, NALSA, Shakti Vahini, Shafin Jahan etc – “and that having regard to our constitutional values, which entail respect to the choice of a person whether or when to enter into marriage and the right to choose a marital partner”.\\n\\nThe three judges, who formed the majority view, called this the “right to relationship”.\\n\\nThe five-bench Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) D Y Chandrachud, which declined to recognise same-sex marriages, also considered the issue of adoption by non-heterosexual couples. The current adoption rules of the country under the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) allow unmarried persons to adopt children only in an individual capacity. Unmarried couples, including queer couples, cannot jointly adopt a child. The eligibility criteria for prospective adoptive parents under Regulation 5 (3) require a couple to have been in at least two years of “stable marital relationship”.\\n\\nCJI Chandrachud said that this Regulation was discriminating against the queer community and hence was violating the Article 15 of the Constitution. The majority view by Justices S Ravindra Bhat, Hima Kohli and P S Narasimha acknowledged that the needs of such couples to have and raise family in every sense of the term has to be accommodated within the framework of the law, but held that the regulation cannot be held void.\\n\\n“This exclusion has the effect of reinforcing the disadvantage already faced by the queer community. Law cannot make an assumption on good and bad parenting based on the sexuality of individuals. Such an assumption perpetuates a stereotype based on sexuality that only heterosexuals are good parents…,” the CJI read out. The CJI said that the regulation shall be read down to exclude the word “marital” so that it includes both married and unmarried couples as well as queer couples so that they too can jointly adopt a child.\\n\\n“Though the additional criteria adopted by the state notifications would also affect a heterosexual person’s eligibility to adopt a child, it would disproportionately affect a non-heterosexual couple, as their unions are not recognised by the law in the form of marriage. An unmarried heterosexual couple has the option of marrying to meet the eligibility but this option is not available to a non-heterosexual couple,” the CJI said.\\n\\nHe said that while the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act granted CARA the power to subscribe additional criteria, it cannot exceed the scope of legislative policy. He said that the JJ Act does not preclude unmarried couples from adopting a child stating that the best interest of the child has to be the main objective.\\n\\nWhile Justice S K Kaul agreed with the CJI, Justices S Ravindra Bhat, Hima Kohli and P S Narasimha had a different view.\\n\\n“This is not to say that unmarried couples whether queer or heterosexual are not capable or suitable to be adoptive parents. However, once the law permits, as it has done adoption by both single individuals, the likelihood of their joining and cohabiting cannot be ruled out. In such an event, de facto family unit can and does come about,” Justice Bhat said.\\n\\nHe added that the Regulation 5 (3) of CARA cannot be held void, at the same time the CARA and Central government ‘should appropriately’ consider such family units where single individuals have committed to adopt and thereafter start living in a non-matrimonial relationship.\\n\\n“In an unforeseen eventuality, the adopted child in question could face exclusion from the benefits otherwise adopted by the children of married couples. This aspect needs consideration for which the court is not the appropriate forum,” Justice Bhat said.\\n\\nThe three judges also said that the underlying assumption in law that unmarried heterosexual or queer couples should not adopt needs to be closely examined. It said that the state needs to explore every possibility and not rule out any policy or legislative choice to ensure maximum welfare and benefits reach the largest number of children.\\n\\n• What are the issues associated with the legalisation of same sex marriage in India?\\n\\n• What is the Special Marriage Act (SMA), 1954?\\n\\n• The legal recognition for same sex marriage is a little more complex-why?\\n\\n• What is the Concept behind marriages in Indian Subcontinent or in the Indian Society?\\n\\n• The Institution of Marriage-Why marriage is referred as an institution?\\n\\n• Why same-sex wedding is not legal in India?\\n\\n• How same sex marriage can be legalised in India?\\n\\n• What is the global acceptance of same-sex marriages?\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍On gay rights, SC moves the needle forward — but walks back on its role\\n\\n📍Safe houses, sensitising police: CJI lists measures against discrimination\\n\\n📍Special Marriage Act: SC says smaller bench can look into issues\\n\\n📍Same-sex marriage petitioners say SC verdict disheartening\\n\\nECONOMY\\n\\nForex swap maturity: Banks get ready to return $5billion to RBI\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Economic and Social Development-Sustainable Development, Poverty, Inclusion, Demographics, Social Sector Initiatives, etc.\\n\\nMains Examination: General Studies III: Indian Economy and issues relating to planning, mobilization, of resources, growth, development and employment.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story-With $5 billion forex swap between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and banks set to mature today, a majority of lenders have arranged for dollars to be delivered to the RBI. In April last year, the RBI conducted a dollar/rupee (USD/INR) sell-buy swap auction for an amount of $ 5 billion. Under the swap, the central bank sold dollars to banks with an agreement to buy back those dollars at maturity, which is October 23.\\n\\n• What is a swap in forex?\\n\\n• What exactly is meant by the term “Dollar-Rupee Swap Auction”?\\n\\n• “The absorption of $5 billion forex swap by the RBI will release Rs 40,000 crore of rupee liquidity into the banking system”-Why this is significant?\\n\\n• What is the liquidity of the banking system?\\n\\n• What is the liquidity deficit of banks in India?\\n\\n• How liquidity is managed by RBI?\\n\\n• Do You Know-Higher demand for dollars created some temporary dollar liquidity shortage in the banking system. In order to meet their dollar demand, banks, in the last few days, bought dollars under USD/INR buy-sell swap either from the interbank market or from exporters or other forex market participants to deliver dollars to the RBI. These swaps are of shorter tenure with maturity of one to two days.\\n\\nForex dealers said it is the RBI which is supplying dollars to the market through select banks.\\n\\nThough banks are expecting the forex swap to mature today, they are not certain how the RBI is going to take the delivery of dollars.\\n\\nSome market participants feel that the central bank may stagger the absorption of dollars over a few days so that banks do not have to supply the entire $5 billion in one go.\\n\\nSpreading of the dollar delivery will not exert pressure on the rupee. This will also mean that the entire Rs 40,000 crore rupee liquidity will not come back to the system in one day.\\n\\nThe RBI has been maintaining that it does not want excessive liquidity in the system as it can pose risks to both price and financial stability. Bankers said that even if the Rs 40,000 of rupee liquidity comes back to the system today, the RBI can use instruments such as variable reverse repo rate auction or OMO-sales (open market operations sales) to manage liquidity.\\n\\nAccording to Investopedia, a foreign currency swap is an agreement between two foreign parties to swap interest payments on a loan made in one currency for interest payments on a loan made in another currency.\\n\\nA foreign currency swap can involve exchanging principal, as well. This would be exchanged back when the agreement ends. Usually, though, a swap involves notional principal that’s just used to calculate interest and isn’t actually exchanged.\\n\\nOne purpose of engaging in a currency swap is to procure loans in foreign currency at more favorable interest rates than might be available borrowing directly in a foreign market.\\n\\nOther Important Articles Covering the same topic:\\n\\n📍Explained: What does RBI’s $5 billion dollar-rupee swap mean?\\n\\nEXPLAINED\\n\\nHas Bidenomics worked?\\n\\nSyllabus:\\n\\nPreliminary Examination: Economic and Social Development-Sustainable Development, Poverty, Inclusion, Demographics, Social Sector Initiatives, etc.\\n\\nMains Examination: General Studies II: Effect of policies and politics of developed and developing countries on India’s interests.\\n\\nKey Points to Ponder:\\n\\n• What’s the ongoing story- 2024 is going to be a massively significant year for the global economy because it will witness elections in some of the biggest and most influential economies. These include India, Russia, the UK, the EU and the US. Together, the GDP of these countries is more than $54 trillion — that’s around 52% of the global GDP in 2023.\\n\\nThanks to a deeply interconnected, between them, these countries and their leaders would not only decide the course of their respective economies but also influence the shape of policymaking in other countries. From the global standpoint, however, the most important election within these could be the one in the US where, as things stand, President Joe Biden is likely to run for re-election.\\n\\nHowever, with just about 12 months left, Biden is facing a stiff challenge from Donald Trump — the man he defeated in 2020. Most opinion polls suggest that President Biden’s approval ratings are at their lowest point.\\n\\n• What is Bidenomics?\\n\\n• For Your Information-According to the White House, Biden’s economic vision is centred around three key pillars:\\n\\n1. Making smart public investments in America\\n\\n2. Empowering and educating workers to grow the middle class\\n\\n3. Promoting competition to lower costs and help entrepreneurs and small businesses thrive\\n\\nIn other words, Bidenomics involves policies that improve US’s physical and digital infrastructure, reduce its trade dependence on rivals such as China, raise the living standards and opportunities available for the middle 40% and the bottom 50% of the US population and, in doing all these things, boost job creation within its borders.\\n\\nTo achieve these goals, the Biden administration has tweaked both the tax regime as well as its spending choices. On the one hand, it aimed to raise $737 billion via more and higher taxation, while on the other, it decided to make fresh spending worth $500 billion towards investments in clean energy and in reducing healthcare costs.\\n\\nIt has also taken several steps to contain the concentration of economic powers in the hands of the few and tried to empower labour unions to safeguard labour rights.\\n\\n• Why Bidenomics matters?\\n\\n• When it comes to Bidenomics, there are two main concerns-What are they?\\n\\n• What is the rationale behind Bidenomics?\\n\\n• For Your Information- In common parlance, Bidenomics is a term that is used to refer to any and every policy choice made by the Biden administration. But the term was not coined by Biden or his team even though they have adopted it over the years. That is not to say that Bidenomics doesn’t have a cogent idea behind it. It does, even though it is a reaction to the dominant way in which the US economy was structured, especially since 1981 when Republican President Ronald Reagan took office.\\n\\nUnder Reagan/ Reaganomics, the idea was to provide tax cuts to the businesses in a bid to incentivise economic activity even as the role of the government in the economy was reduced. The hope was that the resultant benefits of lower taxes and faster economic growth will trickle down to the broader economy. To some extent this happened. But broadly speaking, over the decades since, this top-down approach made the rich richer without necessarily bringing about as much widespread prosperity as its proponents had promised. The sharp rise in inequality — be it of income or wealth — in the ensuing decades is a damning indictment of this approach.\\n\\nThere were many who were not surprised by its failure. Noted economist, and a former US Ambassador to India, John Kenneth Galbraith had said the following for the trickle-down theory: it is “the less than elegant metaphor that if one feeds the horse enough oats, some will pass through to the road for the sparrows.”\\n\\nA June statement by the Biden White House explained why Bidenomics was unveiled: “Even as they faced an immediate economic and public health crisis—with a raging pandemic, elevated unemployment, snarled supply chains, and hundreds of thousands of small businesses at risk of shuttering—the President and Vice President understood that it wouldn’t be enough to simply go back to the economy we had before the pandemic. That economy was saddled with longstanding challenges that held America back—including rising inequality and disinvestment from communities across the country. President Biden recognized that some of those challenges were rooted in a failed trickle-down theory that supported slashing taxes for the wealthy and big corporations, shrinking public investment in critical priorities like infrastructure and education, and failing to safeguard market competition.”\\n\\nBiden bluntly stated: “trickle-down economics has never worked.

       " {'articleBody': 'During a war, political actors, human rights groups, and the media can use unfamiliar terminology without adequately explaining it — or even using it correctly. That’s especially true of the Israel-Hamas war and the broader historical context behind it.\\n\\nTo that end, Vox is writing a glossary to define and contextualize some of these terms, when possible relying on the accepted laws of conflict and international humanitarian law, or IHL.\\n\\nWe’ll include terms that apply specifically to the history of Israel and Palestine, as well as some that apply to conflict generally.\\n\\nBroadly speaking, laws around conduct during armed conflict are found in the Geneva Conventions, the post-World War II agreements that form the basis of IHL. Customary IHL — principles either reflected in international manuals on the laws of war or in precedents from previous legal cases — fills in some of the gaps left by the Geneva Conventions or other treaties.\\n\\nIHL in the context of the Israel-Palestine conflict is often difficult to understand mostly because the situation exceeds the concepts and language set out in the law, Laurel Fletcher, co-director of the International Human Rights Law Clinic at the University of California Berkeley, told Vox. That’s true for many reasons; one of which is that the conflict is between a nation-state (Israel) and Hamas, which is technically a non-state actor though it governs Gaza.\\n\\n“What’s harder in this conflict is that Hamas does not follow the laws of war,” Fletcher said, reportedly using human shields and concealing their operations in civilian infrastructure in Gaza — blurring the lines between a legitimate military target and areas that must be protected under IHL — as well as deliberately killing and kidnapping Israeli civilians.\\n\\nAnother complicating factor is the status of Gaza itself — whether it’s occupied under the terms of international law or whether that occupation is not official but de facto. That “informs Israel’s legal interpretation of what obligations it is under” to Palestinians in Gaza under IHL, Fletcher explained.\\n\\n“International laws did not contemplate this situation,” Fletcher told Vox, and in some senses, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict explodes some of the concepts of IHL; there is not always a clear-cut aggressor in a given round of violence, and the way IHL understands occupation — as a temporary status in which the occupied territory retains its own laws, for example — doesn’t apply to the Israeli-Palestinian context. But IHL still governs armed conflict and all parties are obligated to adhere to it, even if they often don’t.\\n\\nWith that in mind, we’ll point out when the situation on the ground complicates IHL concepts, in recognition of the fact that this is a messy, emotional, evolving conflict — and add to this glossary as the war unfolds.\\n\\nOccupation\\n\\nUnder international law, a territory is considered occupied “when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army” such that the army has “effective control.” There are three elements to consider when determining whether the term fits: whether the foreign army is present without the consent of the local government when it invaded, whether the local government can exercise its powers, and whether the occupying forces exert their own powers over the territory instead.\\n\\nBy that definition, many experts in international law say that Israel has occupied the Gaza Strip, as well as the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Syrian Golan Heights, since 1967. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967, and under the 1947 UN partition plan for the region, the other territories were reserved for a future Palestinian state, while all of Jerusalem was to be governed by an international body.\\n\\nThe nature of Israel’s occupation has varied across these territories and across time, but in all these areas, Israel controls basic utilities, such as water and electricity.\\n\\nThe West Bank, for instance, is under military occupation and has been settled by Israelis, who have become increasingly violent toward Palestinians in the last year.\\n\\nThe Golan Heights are also under Israeli military occupation, and there are more than 30 Israeli settlements in the Golan, home to about 20,000 people. For decades, Syria has refused to sign any peace treaty with Israel unless it cedes control of the Golan Heights.\\n\\nThough Israel has claimed to have annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, it has not done so by the standards of international law, which requires that both the occupying and occupied powers consent to annexation.\\n\\nThen, there’s Gaza: Though Israel withdrew its settlements from Gaza in 2005, it has still exercised effective control of Gaza. While there is not international consensus that this amounts to an occupation, many experts consider it sufficient to meet the international law definition. Even before this war broke out, Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza that restricted access to basic goods and restricted the movement of people in and out of the territory. It controlled all heavily militarized access points to Gaza with the exception of the Rafah crossing with Egypt, which coordinates with Israel to manage it.\\n\\nOccupying powers are charged with certain obligations to the civilian population. That includes taking measures to ensure public order, safety, and sufficient hygiene and health standards, and to provide food and medical care. Occupying powers are also prohibited from forcibly transferring the population from or within the occupied territory and exerting collective punishment on the local population. Finally, occupying powers must allow access to international humanitarian aid.\\n\\nIsrael has deliberately ignored those obligations, especially amid the war in Gaza.\\n\\n“According to international legal authorities, Israel remains [an] occupying power, which means that it has all of the obligations toward civilians that an occupying power would have, which of course does not fulfill,” said Joel Beinin, a professor of Middle East history at Stanford University.\\n\\nOpen-air prison\\n\\nOpen-air prison isn’t terminology under international humanitarian law (IHL) like some of the other words and phrases on this list; rather, it’s used specifically in this context to describe the living conditions in Gaza — particularly, the control and surveillance Palestinians in Gaza live under, but also the general difficulty of accessing basic necessities.\\n\\nDifferent groups, from pro-Palestinian activists to reporters to human rights groups, have applied the concept to Gaza “at least since the late 1990s,” Ilana Feldman, a professor of anthropology, history, and international affairs at George Washington University, wrote in 2015. At the term’s point of origin, Gaza was still under military occupation by Israeli forces— an occupation that lasted 38 years and ended with the complete withdrawal of those troops in 2005.\\n\\nIn that context, the term refers to the lack of independence, the inability to come and go freely; the heavy surveillance of the security state; and the fact that these conditions are being imposed upon Gaza by an outside actor, Israel.\\n\\nToday, many of these factors remain, albeit under a slightly different framework. Since Hamas took power in 2007, Israel (with the help of Egypt) has imposed a blockade on the territory that some human rights groups say amounts to an ongoing occupation that carries legal responsibilities.\\n\\nGaza does not control its land, sea, or air borders. In all but rare cases, Gaza residents cannot leave the 141-square-mile territory through the border crossing with Israel for travel, study, or work opportunities (there are some limited exceptions, like for work permits within Israel). These policies, which Israel justifies on security grounds, don’t just preclude international travel through Israel but also effectively sever Palestinians in Gaza from the West Bank (a territory of Palestinians separated from Gaza by Israeli territory).\\n\\nEgypt, meanwhile, restricts movement through Rafah, its one border crossing, and has at times closed it completely due to concerns that extremists and weapons might make their way to Sinai, where they could launch attacks against Israel and draw Egypt into conflict with Israel. Palestinians in occupied territories are subject to an intense surveillance state. Israel uses facial recognition technology to monitor Palestinians in cities like Hebron, as well as significant CCTV surveillance in public spaces in the Palestinian territories.\\n\\nPoor living conditions caused largely by the blockade on goods have also eroded the quality of life in Gaza, as have repeated, escalating cycles of violence between Hamas and Israel. Poverty rates are 53 percent in Gaza, compared to 14 percent in the other occupied Palestinian territory in the West Bank, according to the International Monetary Fund.\\n\\nNow, under the combined effects of the 16-year blockade and the current conflict, conditions in Gaza are more horrific than ever. The present conditions essentially make Gaza less of an open-air prison and push it more, as Helen Ottens-Patterson, Doctors Without Borders’ former Gaza head of mission, told Vox, toward “the abyss.”\\n\\nCollective punishment\\n\\nCollective punishment refers to a government or occupying force harming a person or group of people based on the actions of another member of their group in the context of an armed conflict. It is a war crime, and it is prohibited under the third and fourth Geneva Conventions, which were ratified after World War II, as well as additional protocols established in 1977.\\n\\nIn its strictest definition, collective punishment applies to “sanctions and harassment of any sort, administrative, by police action or otherwise,” according to customary international law. This is meant to apply specifically to legal and criminal punishments in the context of armed conflict — things like confiscating passports or other documentation, arresting individuals, or imposing other legal penalties on a person not for something they themselves did, but because of the actions of another member of their group or perceived group.\\n\\nThe Syrian civil war provided some examples of this narrow sense; in 2019, for example, the regime of Bashar al-Assad seized assets of the families of people the regime had deemed “terrorists.”\\n\\nColloquially, the term is often applied to a variety of other actions. “The term is used more broadly to include strikes on civilians in response to something that someone else did — their state or some members of their community — as a form of retaliation or revenge,” Adil Haque, a professor at Rutgers University who studies the international law of armed conflict and the philosophy of international law, told Vox in an interview.\\n\\nA UN panel of independent experts said in an October 12 statement that Israel’s airstrikes on Gaza in response to Hamas’s murder and kidnapping of Israeli civilians on October 7 is collective punishment.\\n\\nBut the siege in Gaza is actually violating the laws of occupation rather than collective punishment in the strictest sense, Haque explained, if one considers Gaza to be occupied territory. And if one accepts that Gaza is occupied, the siege can credibly be called a war crime. Though there is debate about whether Gaza is technically occupied — there are no troops on the ground, but Israel controls Gaza’s air, sea, and land borders and many other aspects of life in the territory — occupying powers are obligated under IHL to provide the necessities of life for people in the occupied territory including food, water, medical care, fuel and electricity, and education.\\n\\nIndiscriminate attacks and bombings are also considered to be collective punishment in the colloquial sense of the term, but from an international law perspective, they relate more to the concepts of proportionality and the obligations of all parties to a conflict to protect civilians. For more on those concepts, the International Committee of the Red Cross is a helpful resource.\\n\\nForced displacement\\n\\nForced displacement, sometimes also referred to as forced migration, is permissible under IHL only if it’s occurring to protect civilians in the course of a necessary military operation as part of an international or national conflict. Because it can be considered legal in certain circumstances, then, it’s difficult to prosecute as an individual crime. That prosecution becomes even more complicated when the forced displacement is carried out by a party that could be considered an occupying power. Therefore, it’s often prosecuted as part of other crimes, like ethnic cleansing and genocide, but only if the displacement is motivated by the ethnicity of the group in question.\\n\\nUnder IHL, whoever orders the displacement must ensure that the civilians will eventually be able to return to their homes, that they will be evacuated to a relatively safe location, and that they will be provided with necessities like food, water, shelter, and medical care when they arrive.\\n\\nThe evacuation of British cities during World War II could be considered an instance of legal forced displacement: At the behest of the British government, 1.5 million people left their homes for their safety during the course of an international conflict. They were provided basic necessities when they got to their destinations, and it was understood that they would be able to return to their homes when it was safe to do so.\\n\\nOn October 13, the Israel Defense Forces told the approximately 1.1 million Gaza residents in the north of the territory to leave their homes and head south to avoid being hurt or killed in a military operation. They are not to return to the area until given an order from the authorities.\\n\\nBut Israel didn’t follow IHL in ordering this displacement; the state provided none of the basic necessities it is required to under IHL and in fact has prevented civilians from obtaining those necessities under the ongoing siege. Only after days of negotiations and intense international pressure did authorities in Israel and Egypt allow 20 trucks of humanitarian aid through the Rafah border crossing at Gaza’s southern border.\\n\\nIsrael will defend its operations in northern Gaza as necessary in the course of the war; it’s unclear that international bodies like the International Criminal Court or the United Nations would agree.\\n\\nAnother critical aspect of forced displacement under IHL is that it’s temporary: The civilians who have been moved for their safety must be allowed to return to their homes after the operation or other incident is over. But it’s not clear that this will happen in the context of the Israel-Hamas war.\\n\\nThis concern, deepened by Palestinians’ continued displacement since 1948, is part of the reason Egypt has been unwilling to take in Palestinian refugees from Gaza.\\n\\n“What is happening now in Gaza is an attempt to force civilian residents to take refuge and migrate to Egypt, which should not be accepted,” Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said in a press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz last week.\\n\\nAnnexation\\n\\nAnnexation is “a unilateral act of a State [proclaiming] its sovereignty over the territory of another State” by force or threat of force, per IHL. It is “forbidden by international law.”\\n\\nProhibitions against annexation have been part of international law since World War I, though the concept took on more significance in light of Germany’s actions in World War II. Unlike occupation, annexation is never considered legal under international law.\\n\\n“From an international law perspective, annexation does not happen,” Haque said. That means that while a country might claim territories in conflict or by use of force, and might formally draw their maps to include those territories and impose their laws on the people within them, international law does not recognize those claims.\\n\\nOne clear example of annexation is Russia’s claim that parts of Ukraine — Crimea and the Donbas — are actually Russian. This annexation began as a military operation in 2014, when Russia sent “little green men” into Crimea, and culminated in its ongoing invasion of Ukrainian territory.\\n\\nMoscow made formal announcements when it annexed Crimea and the Donbas; Russian laws now govern those territories, even though international law does not recognize those claims.\\n\\nRegarding the current conflict, there are several contexts in which annexation is discussed.\\n\\nFirst: Israel understands the Golan Heights to be part of its territory and formally annexed it in 1981; however, international law considers it to be Syrian territory occupied by Israel since the 1967 war.\\n\\nThe extent to which Israel views this territory as its own can be seen in the way some politicians speak about it: “I actually consider the last 50 years as the slow process of Israel defining its borders,” Einat Wilf, a former Labour member of the Knesset, said on the podcast The Hated and the Dead a few days before Hamas’s October 7 attack. “With the peace agreement with Egypt and the peace agreement with Jordan and the getting out of Lebanon and the annexation of the Golan Heights, Israel enters a process of determining its final borders.”\\n\\nThen there’s the matter of East Jerusalem and the West Bank — territories that do not belong to Israel, according to a 1947 United Nations partition plan for the region. Over time, Israel has encroached on East Jerusalem, building settlements and evicting Palestinian families from their homes. Tensions over access to the al-Aqsa mosque, or Temple Mount — a holy site to both Muslims and Jews — have flared in recent years.\\n\\nAnd finally, there’s the West Bank, an area that was reserved under the UN plan for a future Palestinian state. Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which has a majority Palestinian population but is occupied by Israel, are, for some settlers, part of a project to ultimately annex the region. “Over time, messianic Religious Zionist ideology developed as a significant driver of the settlement movement, based on the notion of a religious imperative for Jews to settle the entire Land of Israel,” according to a brief by the Israel Policy Forum, an American Jewish organization working for a two-state solution. “Settlements established as part of this religious movement were often placed in regions with a large Palestinian population in order to secure Jewish dominance over the territory, prevent a Palestinian state, and secure the entire West Bank for Israel.”\\n\\nThe US later recognized the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights under Trump and reaffirmed it under Biden. The US under Trump also moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2017 — a move made in recognition of the fact that Israel had made unified Jerusalem its capital, but a decidedly controversial one in the international arena, given the international legal issues. Trump’s administration also argued in 2019 that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are not necessarily illegal, lending legitimacy to Israel’s claims on the territories. But the annexations and moves toward it are widely regarded as illegal under international law, and no other country has recognized them.\\n\\nNormalization\\n\\nNormalization refers to efforts to establish diplomatic relations between Israel and neighboring Arab countries with the aim of achieving stability, if not peace, in the Middle East.\\n\\nBeginning in 1945, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen, and what is now known as Jordan formed an “Arab League” that opposed the state of Israel because of the Palestinian Arab population that was displaced as a result of its inception in 1948. It sought to advance the Palestinian cause, often by use of force. Some member countries repeatedly and violently clashed with Israel — including in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the 1967 Six-Day War, and the 1973 Yom Kippur War — and helped create the Palestine Liberation Organization, a coalition of Palestinian nationalists, initially as a form of militant opposition to Israel.\\n\\nIt’s been decades since those Arab League countries directly fought Israel, and two of them have signed peace treaties with Israel — Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994. That’s even though the plight of Palestinians remains unresolved, with US-led talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank, frozen since 2014.\\n\\nThe US has consequently sought to establish diplomatic, economic, and security channels between Israel and its Arab neighbors with the objective of achieving a level of regional stability that would allow it to turn its attention to other parts of the world, including Russia and China. The Trump administration facilitated the Abraham Accords to normalize relations between Israel and several of its Muslim-majority neighbors — the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan — members of the now-expanded Arab League, but not ones that have ever been at war with Israel. The Biden administration also sought to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, in part so that they could form a united front against Iran, a common adversary that financially supports Hamas.\\n\\nPublic support in Arab countries for normalization has been low. But for the leaders of the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco, signing a normalization agreement with Israel made sense since relations between those countries already “were in some respects quite close, if not public before those Abraham accords were signed,” said Beinin, the professor of Middle East history at Stanford University. It also has facilitated arms sales between the signatory countries.\\n\\nSince the outbreak of war in Gaza, the Saudis have been talking to Iran, seemingly dooming the prospect of a normalization deal for now.\\n\\nZionism\\n\\nZionism is a movement that supports the establishment of a permanent homeland for Jewish people in the region now known as Israel and Palestine.\\n\\nIts roots as a political movement date back to the late 19th century following the outbreak of pogroms targeting Jews in what was then Russia, present-day Ukraine, and Poland, where Jews were unfairly blamed for the assassination of Czar Alexander II. The violence and the broader rise in antisemitism in Europe in that period drove many Jews toward political activism, including nationalist movements such as Zionism.\\n\\nNot all Jews were Zionists (and not all Jews are Zionists now, either). In fact, it was initially a minority movement led by Austrians and Germans. Austrian journalist Theodor Herzl is regarded as the father of modern Zionism, formalizing the ideology in his 1896 German-language pamphlet “The Jewish State.” In it, he argued that the only way Jews could be freed from persecution and discrimination amid rising antisemitism in Europe was to establish, with the support of the international community, their own secular nation. He argued that Palestine was the ideal location because of its historical and religious significance to Jews, the Land of Israel promised to them by God in the Bible and from which they were forced into centuries of exile.\\n\\nHerzl unsuccessfully sought support for the program from the Ottoman Empire, which then controlled Palestine. But he found an ally in Britain, which offered Zionists 6,000 square miles of uninhabited land in Uganda or locations in other countries. But the Zionists wanted Palestine, and tens of thousands of Jews from Europe began to emigrate there anyway.\\n\\nThe British would later come around, however, in their 1917 Balfour Declaration, which unilaterally called for the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine, despite the fact that Jewish people made up less than 15 percent of the population there at the time. Though the declaration vowed that “nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,” it did not outline what those communities were, what specific rights they had, or how they would be protected, and it didn’t take into account their thoughts about how their land should be used.\\n\\nAfter World War I, the Allied powers backed the declaration, and the newly created League of Nations gave Britain a mandate to temporarily rule Palestine until the Jewish state could be created. Jewish immigration to the area increased, particularly in the early to mid-1930s and after the horrors of the Holocaust, and the influx sparked violent clashes at various times. After World War II, the United Nations agreed to partition Palestine into two states, one for the area’s Jewish population and another for the Arab population, with the city of Jerusalem to be governed by a special international entity. However, local Arabs and Arab countries objected to the plan.\\n\\nFollowing a period of extreme violence before, during, and after the war — particularly on the part of Zionist militias — British forces withdrew from Palestine, and Israel declared its independence on May 14, 1948. It won the war with neighboring Arab states that followed, capturing 77 percent of the previous Palestinian mandate territory, including land that the UN had intended to allocate to the Palestinian Arab population.\\n\\nIsrael later ended up giving some of that land back to neighboring Arab countries as part of agreements brokered to end various bouts of armed conflict that broke out over the decades. But in 1980, it also annexed East Jerusalem — home to holy sites of significance to Jews, Muslims, and Christians — in a move violating international law, as well as occupied and encroached on Palestinian territory in the West Bank and in Gaza. In 2005, the Israeli government under right-wing Prime Minister Ariel Sharon withdrew entirely from Gaza and dismantled four Israeli settlements in the West Bank in a bid to improve Israeli security.\\n\\nToday, with the Jewish state of Israel firmly established, Zionism remains a diverse movement that encompasses people with a broad range of beliefs, including on the policies of the Israeli government. Many Jews feel a kinship to Israel, even if they do not explicitly identify as Zionist. Leftist Zionists believe in Israel’s right to exist peacefully but may also support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Palestinian self-determination. Right-wing Zionists, on the other hand, have promoted expansionist policies and Israeli settlements in occupied territory.\\n\\nIn recent years, it’s those right-wing Zionists who have had control of the Israeli government. They have since built more settlements in the West Bank, undertaking a de facto annexation in parts, and there are fears that Gaza may be next.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'The Jews are a very remarkable people. Originally, they were a small tribe—or several tribes—in Palestine, and their early story is told in the Old Testament of the Bible. Rather conceited they were, thinking themselves as the Chosen People. But this is a conceit in which nearly all people have indulged.\\n\\nThey were repeatedly conquered and suppressed and enslaved, and some of the most beautiful and moving poems in English are the songs and laments of these Jews as given in the authorised translation of the Bible. I suppose in the original Hebrew they are equally, or even more, beautiful. I shall give you just a few lines from one of the Psalms:\\n\\n‘By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept ; when we remembered thee,\\n\\nO Sion.\\n\\nAs for our harps we hanged them up: upon the trees that are therein.\\n\\nFor they that led us away captive required of us then a song, and melody, in our heaviness: Sing us one of the songs of Sion.\\n\\nHow shall we sing the Lord’s song: in a strange land?\\n\\nIf I forgot thee, O Jerusalem: let my right hand forget her cunning.\\n\\nIf I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: yea,\\n\\nif I prefer not Jerusalem in my mirth.’\\n\\nThese Jews were finally dispersed all over the world. They had no home or nation, and everywhere they went, they were treated as unwelcome and undesirable strangers. They were made to live in special areas of cities, apart from the others—these areas were called ghettos—so that they might not pollute others. Sometimes they were made to put on a special dress. They were humiliated, reviled, tortured, and massacred.\\n\\nThe very word ‘Jew’ became a word of abuse, a synonym for a miser and a grasping money-lender. And yet these amazing people not only survived all this, but managed to keep their racial and cultural characteristics, and prospered and produced a host of great men.\\n\\nToday, they hold leading positions as scientists, statesmen, literary men, financiers, businessmen, and even the greatest socialists and communists have been Jews. Most of them, of course, are far from prosperous; they crowd in the cities of eastern Europe and, from time to time, suffer pogroms or massacres.\\n\\nThese people without home or country, and especially the poor among them, have never ceased to dream of old Jerusalem, which appears to their imaginations greater and more magnificent than it ever was in fact. Zion they called Jerusalem, a kind of promised land, and Zionism is this call of the past that pulls them to Jerusalem and Palestine.\\n\\n***',\n",

The timing of a long expected full-scale Israeli ground invasion remained unclear Thursday, but the consequences of Israel\\'s relentless airstrikes, which started immediately after Hamas\\' brutal terror attack on Israel, have already been catastrophic for the 2.3 million people trapped inside Gaza.\\n\\nThe United Nations estimates that some 1.4 million people have been displaced from their homes within the densely populated region. Gaza\\'s health care system is on the verge of total collapse, with over half of its health care facilities no longer functioning, according to the World Health Organization. Water is running out, along with stocks of anesthesia and other vital medicines. Some aid has started flowing in this week, but crucially, no fuel supplies have been allowed across the border into Gaza.\\n\\nThe stream of injured being rushed to Gaza\\'s hospitals after airstrikes continues.

The total toll in Gaza since Israel started its airstrikes stands at over 7,000, according to the ministry, including the disputed death toll from an explosion at the al-Ahli hospital last week.\\n\\nIsrael says Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in its unprecedented attack on October 7 and with its ongoing rocket attacks. The Israeli military said Thursday that 224 people were still believed to be held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. Hamas\\' military wing said, meanwhile, that Israel had killed 50 of the hostages with its airstrikes on Gaza.\\n\\nAid agencies and many countries in the region have warned that an Israeli ground incursion will mean even greater loss of civilian life.\\n\\nDr. Muhammed Kandeel, who works at the Nasser Hospital in Gaza, told CBS News he doesn\\'t even have water to wash his hands sometimes, risking infection among the many wounded people he\\'s treating.\\n\\n\"They will know they are going to die, because the hospitals have nothing to offer them,\" he said. \"It cannot be described by words. It\\'s hell.\"\\n\\nHe said the situation is so horrific that he has almost given up.\\n\\n\"We feel we are not a part of the human community,\" Kandeel told CBS News. \"If we are sub-human, just tell us, so we can take action by ourselves.\"\\n\\nThose who cannot be saved are taken to morgues where overwhelmed staff have been running out of the traditional Islamic shrouds used to prepare bodies for burial. And every day brings new airstrikes and fresh trauma.\\n\\nOvernight, Al Jazeera journalist Wael Al Dahdouh said he learned that his wife, daughter and son were killed alongside 12 other members of his family. They had relocated to the south of Gaza, where they hoped to find relative safety as Israel\\'s military has repeatedly urged Palestinians to evacuate to the area.\\n\\n\"Strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law, including the taking of feasible precautions to mitigate civilian casualties,\" the IDF said in a statement shared with CBS News on Thursday. \"Regarding this specific case, the IDF targeted Hamas terrorist infrastructure in the area.\"\\n\\nPalestinian militants from Hamas and other groups have fired barrages of rockets into Israel since the war began, most of which have been intercepted by Israel\\'s Iron Dome defense system. The IDF says it only strikes militant targets in Gaza and accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields, hiding weapons and command centers in schools, mosques and other civilian infrastructure.\\n\\nIsrael has allowed 74 trucks carrying aid into Gaza through the Rafah crossing from Egypt, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Thursday. Aid workers say it\\'s nowhere near what is necessary, and is only a fraction of the aid that was coming in every day before the war. Israel says it won\\'t allow fuel deliveries into Gaza because Hamas will use it to continue its assault, and it has accused the group — long designated a terror organization by the U.S., Israel and most European nations — of hoarding fuel there.\\n\\nUNRWA, the U.N. organization that works with Palestinians across the region, has been sharing its fuel supplies to power generators so water can be desalinated, bread can be baked and hospitals can keep incubators and life support machines running. The agency said it\\'s being forced to ration its fuel supplies, or it could run out as soon as Thursday.\\n\\n\"Do we give for the incubators or the bakeries?\" UNRWA spokeswoman Tamara Alrifai told The Associated Press. \"It is an excruciating decision.\"',\n",

       " {'articleBody': \"JERUSALEM (AP) — How many Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the war between Israel and Hamas started?\\n\\nWith Israel besieging and bombing territory at a scale never seen before, arriving at a precise answer isn’t easy. Cell service is spotty. Internet and power are out. Airstrikes have pulverized roads and leveled neighborhoods, slowing rescue work.\\n\\nDoctors scribble on notepads in overflowing morgues and hospital halls, struggling to account for bodies trapped under rubble and tossed in hastily dug mass graves. The chaos has added to the likelihood of errors.\\n\\nYet the Gaza-based Ministry of Health — an agency in the Hamas-controlled government — continues to tally casualty numbers. It released its first detailed report on the casualties Thursday, giving names, ID numbers, ages and gender for Palestinians it says have been killed. The total toll is 7,028 Palestinians, including 2,913 minors, according to the ministry.\\n\\nThe ministry is the only official source for Gaza casualties. Israel has sealed Gaza’s borders, barring foreign journalists and humanitarian workers. The AP is among a small number of international news organizations with teams in Gaza. While those journalists cannot do a comprehensive count, they’ve viewed large numbers of bodies at the sites of airstrikes, morgues and funerals.\\n\\nThe United Nations and other international institutions and experts, as well as Palestinian authorities in the West Bank — rivals of Hamas — say the Gaza ministry has long made a good-faith effort to account for the dead under the most difficult conditions.\\n\\n“The numbers may not be perfectly accurate on a minute-to-minute basis,” said Michael Ryan, of the World Health Organization’s Health Emergencies Program. “But they largely reflect the level of death and injury.”\\n\\nIn previous wars, the ministry’s counts have held up to U.N. scrutiny, independent investigations and even Israel’s tallies.\\n\\nBut an outlier is the ministry’s death toll from an explosion at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City last week.\\n\\nThere were conflicting accusations of who was responsible, with Hamas officials blaming an Israeli airstrike and Israel saying it was caused by a an errant rocket launched by Palestinian militants. U.S. and French intelligence services also concluded it was likely caused by a misfired rocket. An AP analysis of video, photos and satellite imagery, as well as consultation with experts, showed the cause was likely a rocket launched from Palestinian territory that misfired and crashed. However, a definitive conclusion couldn’t be reached.\\n\\nThere have also been conflicting accounts of the explosion’s death toll. Within an hour, Gaza’s ministry reported 500 Palestinians killed, then lowered that to 471 the next day. Israel says the ministry inflated the toll. American intelligence agencies estimate 100 to 300 people killed, but haven’t said how they arrived at the numbers.\\n\\nThe confusion has called into question the ministry’s credibility in the Hamas-ruled territory.\\n\\nHere’s a look at how Gaza’s Health Ministry has generated death tolls since the war started.\\n\\nHOW DOES THE MINISTRY ARRIVE AT A DEATH TOLL?\\n\\nGaza’s most widely quoted source on casualties is Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra. From an office at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, al-Qidra receives a constant flow of data from every hospital in the strip.\\n\\nHospital administrators say they keep records of every wounded person occupying a bed and every dead body arriving at a morgue. They enter this data into a computerized system shared with al-Qidra and colleagues. According to screenshots hospital directors sent to AP, the system looks like a color-coded spreadsheet divided into categories: name, ID number, date of hospital entry, type of injury, condition.\\n\\nNames aren’t always available, al-Qidra said. He and colleagues face disruptions because of spotty connectivity but say they call to double-check the numbers.\\n\\nThe ministry collects data from other sources, too, including the Palestinian Red Crescent.\\n\\n“Every person entering our hospital is recorded,” said Atef Alkahlout, director of Gaza’s Indonesian Hospital. “That’s a priority.”\\n\\nThe ministry releases casualty updates every few hours, providing the number of dead and wounded with a breakdown for men, women and minors. The ministry generally doesn’t provide names, ages or locations of those killed. That information comes from reporters on the ground or the Hamas-run government media office.\\n\\nBut Thursday, in response to U.S. doubts over its figures, the ministry released a 212-page report listing every Palestinian killed in the war so far, including their names, ID numbers, ages and gender. A copy of the report shared with the AP names 6,747 Palestinians and says an additional 281 bodies have not yet been identified. The list did not provide a breakdown by location.\\n\\nThe ministry never distinguishes between civilians and combatants. That becomes clearer after the dust settles, when the U.N. and rights groups investigate and militant groups offer a tally of members killed. The Israeli military also conducts post-war investigations.\\n\\nThe Health Ministry doesn’t report how Palestinians were killed, whether from Israeli airstrikes and artillery barrages or other means, like errant Palestinian rocket fire. It describes all casualties as victims of “Israeli aggression.”\\n\\nThat lack of transparency has drawn criticism.\\n\\n“When the Hamas health agency comes out with the numbers, take it with a pinch of salt,” Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, Israeli military spokesman, said in a briefing Thursday. But he repeatedly declined to offer any alternative number of Palestinian casualties.\\n\\nIsrael says more than 1,400 civilians and soldiers were killed and over 200 hostages seized when Hamas invaded Israel. The army has identified 309 of those killed as soldiers so far.\\n\\nWHO WORKS IN THE MINISTRY?\\n\\nHamas, as Gaza’s ruling authority, exerts control over the Health Ministry. But it’s different than political and security agencies that Hamas runs.\\n\\nThe Palestinian Authority, which controlled Gaza before Hamas overran the area in 2007, retains power over health and education services in Gaza, though it’s based in the occupied West Bank. The ministry is a mix of recent Hamas hires and older civil servants affiliated with the secular nationalist Fatah party, officials say.\\n\\nThe Fatah-dominated authority that administers Palestinian cities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank has its own health ministry in Ramallah, which still provides medical equipment to Gaza, pays Health Ministry salaries and handles patient transfers from the blockaded enclave to Israeli hospitals.\\n\\nHealth Minister Mai al-Kaila in Ramallah oversees the parallel ministries, which receive the same data from hospitals. Her deputy is based in Gaza.\\n\\nThe Ramallah ministry said it trusts casualty figures from partners in Gaza, and it takes longer to publish figures because it tries to confirm numbers with its own Gaza staff.\\n\\nHamas tightly controls access to information and runs the government media office that offers details on Israeli airstrikes. But employees of the Health Ministry insist Hamas doesn’t dictate casualty figures.\\n\\n“Hamas is one of the factions. Some of us are aligned with Fatah, some are independent,” said Ahmed al-Kahlot, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza. “More than anything, we are medical professionals.”\\n\\nWHAT IS THE TRACK RECORD FROM PAST WARS?\\n\\nThroughout four wars and numerous bloody skirmishes between Israel and Hamas, U.N. agencies have cited the Health Ministry’s death tolls in regular reports. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Palestinian Red Crescent also use the numbers.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of war, the U.N. humanitarian office has published final death tolls based on its own research into medical records.\\n\\nIn all cases the U.N.'s counts have largely been consistent with the Gaza Health Ministry’s, with small discrepancies.\\n\\n— 2008 war: The ministry reported 1,440 Palestinians killed; the U.N. reported 1,385.\\n\\n— 2014 war: The ministry reported 2,310 Palestinians killed; the U.N. reported 2,251.\\n\\n— 2021 war: The ministry reported 260 Palestinians killed; the U.N. reported 256.\\n\\nWhile Israel and the Palestinians disagree over the numbers of militants versus civilians killed in past wars, Israel’s accounts of Palestinian casualties have come close to the Gaza ministry’s. For instance, Israel’s Foreign Ministry said the 2014 war killed 2,125 Palestinians — just a bit lower than the ministry’s toll.\\n\\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has killed “thousands” of militants in the current war, without offering evidence or precise numbers.\\n\\nInternational news agencies, including AP, as well as humanitarian workers and rights groups, have used the ministry’s numbers when independent verification is impossible.\\n\\n“These figures are professionally done and have proven to be reliable,” said Omar Shakir, Human Rights Watch’s Israel and Palestine director, adding he remained “cognizant of different blind spots and weaknesses” such as the failure to distinguish between civilians and combatants.\\n\\nWHAT ABOUT THE HOSPITAL BLAST?\\n\\nLess than an hour after images of the explosion surfaced on social media, the ministry reported that 200 to 300 people had been killed at al-Ahli Hospital. A half-hour later, the ministry put that toll at a staggering 500. The next day, it revised the number down to 471, without releasing details.\\n\\nWestern intelligence agencies said they believed the toll was considerably lower.\\n\\nU.S. President Joe Biden said he had “no confidence” in the accuracy of the ministry’s reporting. However, the U.S. government’s annual human rights assessments from the region frequently cite the Gaza ministry.\\n\\nGaza’s Health Ministry stands by the 471 figure and includes it in the total death toll. When asked about conflicting accounts, authorities emphasize the difficulties of their work and vigorously deny any fabrication.\\n\\n“We had a uniquely hard time because the bodies were so dismembered, body parts were everywhere,” Health Ministry official Mehdat Abbas said.\",\n",

       " {'articleBody': '“The wounded keep dying in front of your eyes but there’s nothing you can do, and I think that is a trauma I will carry with me for all my life,” Bassel Amr, a volunteer ICU physician told Middle East Eye. He called the aftermath of ground attacks ‘beyond worst case scenario’ as the situation on the ground in Gaza unfolds.\\n\\nGaza’s hospitals were already at full capacity, tending to patients, including those who were wounded, pregnant women, children, and newborn infants in the aftermath of Israeli airstrikes. Unfortunately, with the recent ground invasion, the situation has further deteriorated. In addition to the existing patients, healthcare personnel are now also confronted with trauma injuries resulting from ground attacks.\\n\\n“The smell of blood and sand is everywhere,” Dr Mohammad Mattar, head of radiology department at Al-Shifa Hospital which is Gaza strip’s largest and as of now only operational medical complex since other places have run out of fuel told NPR.\\n\\n“We are left in a situation where we have to make the difficult decision to risk the life of one patient in order to save the life of another,” Dr Amr said.\\n\\n“We already warned a few days ago that the hospital won’t be able to deal with any other crisis in coming days since the equipment and necessary tools were already running out, now after the ground raids, it has become impossible to hunt for any resources, hence we have to utilise whatever is left,” he added.\\n\\nWhen Israel started to prepare for its planned ground invasion of Gaza, it warned the residents in the north to flee south so that they don’t become a target, that included hospitals too. But healthcare community in Gaza insisted that the evacuation of the wounded and displaced would be impossible.\\n\\n“As of now, around 600 babies are in incubators and out of them, 120 are in critical life-or-death situation. With no fuel, we’re left with no choice but to choose between who we can save and who we cannot, and I have never endured a more heart-wren\\xadching situation in my entire career,” Dr Amr said.\\n\\nAl-Shifa hospital currently accommodates 62,000 displaced individuals, and the rapid spread of viruses is a growing concern. This exacerbates the issue of inadequate sterilisation within the hospital, leaving patients susceptible to infections. Further\\xadmore, most hospitals had to make morgues in the functional wards to accommodate the dead bodies which are still there and the count of everyday is in hundreds.\\n\\n“All of it cannot be evacuated suddenly,” an intern at Al-Shifa told Reuters.\\n\\nInternational groups have issued warnings regarding the potential for water-borne diseases and scabies due to the shortage of clean water in the area. Amr further noted that the nature of injuries treated at his hospital, primarily involving scarring and disfigurements, foreshadows an impending health crisis following the conclusion of hostilities.\\n\\nDr. Hussam al-Madhoun echoed a comparable scenario at the Al-Awda hospital in the northern Gaza region which has become partially non-functional as of now since it has completely run out of fuel.\\n\\nHe emphasised that the hospital is extremely overcrowded, with “no space to walk,” as thousands of civilians have sought shelter there due to the Israeli airstrikes. Similar to the situation at Al-Shifa, Al-Awda is grappling with insufficient capacity to handle casualties and is facing a critical shortage of medical supplies, especially after ground invasion.\\n\\nHe added that Gaza is now suffering from a shortage of shrouds.“There is nothing worse than not finding enough shrouds to cover the martyrs, so you wrap them with garbage bags and old pieces of cloth,” he said.\\n\\n“Now, with the ongoing siege and the fuel running out, a humanitarian catastrophe is imminent, and we will lose patients in our department and possibly thousands of patients in the entire hospital,” he added.\\n\\nPreviously, in a video released by DW Cut, doctors have pleaded several times that Gaza is about to experience a total collapse of the healthcare system due to supplies running out like sand in hand and the number of casualties increasing each day.\\n\\nPublished in Dawn, October 27th, 2023',\n",

Some of the images had circulated online before, in some cases in truncated and edited form, but most of what we saw was unedited and very disturbing.\\n\\nThe IDF said it compiled the images from militants\\' body cameras, victims\\' dash cams and cellphones, security cameras at kibbutzim, and other sources. The IDF decided to share them, international spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht told me, as part of his country\\'s \"narrative battle.\" It comes as international criticism mounts over civilian casualties in Israel\\'s military campaign in Gaza.\\n\\n\"We understand that there\\'s a narrative battle here and that we have to show the world what happened here,\" Hecht said. \"We\\'re doing everything we can to show the media that there\\'s a reason why we\\'re doing what we\\'re doing. [Hamas] started this in the most heinous way.\"\\n\\nIsrael Defense Forces spokesman Maj. Gen. Mickey Edelstein speaks to an auditorium full of journalists at a military base north of Tel Aviv, Oct. 23, 2023. CBS News/Cameron Stewart\\n\\nWe were not allowed to record the images played for us by the IDF — we were told, out of respect for grieving families. The Hamas militants who launched the surprise attack on Israel operated on a much different policy, filming and livestreaming parts of their murderous rampage with body or helmet cameras.\\n\\nNot all of the material could be independently verified by the news media. This is some of what we were shown:\\n\\nHamas militants lobbing a grenade into what appears to be a home bomb shelter, killing a father before he could slam the door shut. His young sons, wearing only their underwear, were splattered with blood but survived. In another clip, the boys are in their kitchen, crying out for their mother, as one attacker pulls a Coca-Cola from their refrigerator and takes a leisurely sip. The younger brother says he can\\'t see out of one eye and asks, \"Why am I alive?\"\\n\\nSome journalists in the hall gasped and held their heads in their hands.\\n\\nIn another clip, a militant stands over a man who appears to have been shot in the gut and hacks at him multiple times with a garden hoe.\\n\\nAs Hamas fighters raged through another kibbutz, we watched them set fire to a home; shoot a black Labrador trotting toward them; and execute a man in a living room chair through his screen door — he groans and slumps over.\\n\\nWe also saw clips of militants firing at close range at two women huddling in fear under a desk; spraying bullets at unsuspecting drivers until their cars slow to a halt; dragging bloodied bodies out of one car and driving it away.\\n\\nAt the Nova music festival, we saw young Israelis smiling and dancing; later, Hamas militants fire at festival-goers hiding under cars and then meticulously shoot into a line of portable toilets. They toss hostages — bloodied and barely moving — into a pile in the back of a pickup truck.\\n\\nDuring the screening, most journalists sat silently watching. A few peered at the videos through their fingers. At least one was crying.\\n\\nThen there is a chilling cellphone recording the IDF said it retrieved from a call-recording app on a phone found at the scene — a Hamas fighter\\'s call to his parents in Gaza, boasting, \"Dad, I killed 10 [Jews] with my bare hands.\"\\n\\n\"Mahmood, where are you?\" his father asks.\\n\\nMahmood names a kibbutz in southern Israel, adding, \"Please, be proud of me.\"\\n\\nWe hear his mother cry in the background, \"Promise you\\'ll return home!\"\\n\\nAfter the viewing, IDF Major General Mickey Edelstein explained why the IDF had invited international journalists there to watch the videos: He said he was \"shocked\" to see some media trying to equate Israel\\'s actions in Gaza with Hamas\\'s atrocities in Israel. \"Is it equal? I cannot understand such a comparison,\" he said.\\n\\nIsrael says Hamas\\' attacks have killed more than 1,400 people and left 5,400 wounded. More than two weeks of Israel\\'s retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza have killed nearly 5,800 people and injured almost 16,300, according to Gaza\\'s Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas.\\n\\nAs images of the devastation in Gaza — including Palestinian women and children displaced, maimed, killed or weeping for their loved ones — have filled the airwaves and social media, Israeli authorities have become keenly aware that the sympathy their country received after the Oct. 7 attacks has been waning as international condemnation grows — a shift that Hamas appears ready to exploit.\\n\\n\"I think at this point Hamas is winning the information campaign,\" Karin von Hippel, director-general of the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) thinktank, told CBS News. She said that wasn\\'t necessarily because of the militant group\\'s own public relations efforts, but because it has many \"multipliers and enablers\" and because of the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\\n\\n\"The Israelis need to be incredibly careful because they generated a lot of sympathy from various quarters in the immediate aftermath [of the October 7 attacks],\" she said, \"but it appears they\\'re killing too many civilians now in Gaza.\"\\n\\n\"We are not fighting the civilians, the kids in Gaza,\" Lt. Col. Hecht told CBS News. \"But this is a very complex situation, and we will make sure Hamas is eradicated.\"\\n\\nWhen I asked him about criticism that Israel must do more to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza and that it has struck civilians who had evacuated to southern Gaza after Israel warned them to leave the north, Hecht responded that Hamas is \"using their people as… human shields… [Hamas] wants their people to get hurt.\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re doing everything we can to notify civilians to move,\" he said. \"But you saw the visuals. [Hamas] came in and they went for anyone they could, and we have the obligation for this not to happen again. We\\'re protecting our nation.\"\\n\\n\"Israel is playing catch up, which is why they did the international press briefing,\" said Fran Townsend, who was a National Security Advisor to President George W. Bush and is now a senior CBS News national security consultant.\\n\\nTownsend added, however, that even if Hamas was commanding the narrative by tapping \"into the heat of emotions in a way governments seem incapable of doing,\" officials in Washington and Israel, \"tend to think that the righteousness of our argument will carry the day.\"\\n\\nWhen I pointed out to Hecht that many people felt sympathy for Israelis who suffered in the Oct. 7 attacks, but they also feel sympathy for Palestinian civilians in Gaza, he said, \"So do we.\"\\n\\n\"But this is a very complex situation, and we will make sure Hamas is eradicated,\" he said.\\n\\nThe current \"narrative battle\" is nothing new, noted Von Hippel at RUSI. \"Obviously, there has been a lot of sympathy for the Palestinians over many years and in many parts of the world, and it\\'s very easy to rile up that base.\"',\n",

Esmail Qaani, the head of Quds Force, attended the training activities led by the IRGC.\\n\\nThe country’s influence on the Israel-Hamas war, and on the region as a whole, can be seen in the warnings issued against the US and Israel by Iranian officials since October 7.\\n\\nEarlier this week, the BBC reported that during a press conference in Tehran, Abdollahian warned “the US and its proxy Israel that if they do not immediately stop the crime against humanity and genocide in Gaza, anything is possible at any moment and the region will go out of control,”\\n\\nFollowing the Security Council’s failure to pass a resolution on the Israel-Hamas war, a UNGA vote on a draft resolution put forth by Arab states calling for a ceasefire is scheduled to take place on Friday.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn addition, a Tenth Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly has been called for Thursday on the topic of “illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.”\\n\\nDuring his visit, the Iranian foreign minister is expected to meet with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to discuss Iran’s position on the war, telling IRNA News that “the support that the United States and a few European countries blindly but wholeheartedly provide to the Zionist regime has reached a worrying point for all the countries in the region.”\\n\\nAbdollahian will also present Iran’s views during the UNGA’s Thursday session, where he will reiterate that any resolution passed regarding the war must advocate for “the immediate cessation of war crimes and genocide against civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, the immediate and extensive delivery of humanitarian aid and combating the forced relocation of Gaza residents.”\\n\\nThe Iranian minister sent a letter to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk on Wednesday in which he stressed that Iran expects the United Nations to immediately call for a halt on Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and described the “inaction on the part of the international community against the Zionist regime crimes as a catalyst for the Zionist war criminals to intensify their campaign.”\\n\\nIsrael launched its operation against Hamas 19 days ago, after some 2,500 terrorists poured into Israel from the Gaza Strip on October 7, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and injuring some 5,400 others in a violent massacre. An additional 228 people were taken hostage, of whom just four have been released.\\n\\nIn response, Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas from the Gaza Strip, where they have ruled since 2007, and to destroy the group’s infrastructure in its entirety.\\n\\nEarlier this week, Israel stopped issuing visas to UN officials after Guterres implied that Hamas’s October 7 massacre was caused by Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and Palestinian territories.\\n\\n“It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum,” he said in his strongly criticized remarks.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing.”\\n\\nContrary to Guterres’s statement, Israel has not had any military or civilian presence in the Gaza Strip since its unilateral withdrawal in 2005. Since then, both Israel and Egypt have maintained tight control of Gaza’s borders in response to the ruling terror group’s years of rocket fire and attacks against Israel.\\n\\nFollowing the UN chief’s comments, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen canceled a meeting with him, and Minister Benny Gantz branded him a “terror apologist.”\\n\\nGuterres on Wednesday rejected the criticism and doubled down on his position, saying his remarks had been misrepresented.\\n\\n“I am shocked by misrepresentations by some of my statement yesterday in the Security Council — as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas,” Guterres told reporters, without naming Israel.\\n\\n“I spoke of the grievances of the Palestinian people. And in doing so, I also clearly stated, and I quote: ‘But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas.’”\\n\\nIsrael’s Ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, rejected Guterres’s clarification and reiterated the call for him to resign.\\n\\nTimes of Israel staff contributed to this report.\",\n",

He held the body of her 8-month-old stillborn child, also wrapped in white, in his arms.\\n\\nGAZA CIVILIANS GROW MORE DESPERATE\\n\\nAs Gaza\\'s 2.3 million civilians grow more desperate under a siege that has cut power and water as well as supplies of food, fuel and medicine, the issue of aid comes before the 193-member U.N. General Assembly in New York on Friday.\\n\\nUnlike in the U.N. Security Council, where resolutions on aid for Gaza failed this week, there can be no veto on the resolution by Arab states calling for a ceasefire, which will not be binding but carry political weight.\\n\\nThe U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, says more than 600,000 Gazans have been made homeless, at least three times more than its shelters can hold.\\n\\nTen more trucks of food and medical supplies arrived in Gaza from Egypt, along with 10 foreign doctors - the first to enter since Israel tightened its blockade nearly three weeks ago, a Palestinian official said.\\n\\nThis made for around 84 trucks in three weeks. The U.N. says Gaza needs around 100 relief trucks every day, and the official said negotiations were taking place with Israel, which wants to prevent resources reaching Hamas, to find a faster mechanism.\\n\\nUNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said 57 UNRWA workers had been killed in Israeli bombardments, and U.N. human rights spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani became emotional when describing conditions for U.N. staff:\\n\\n\"Many of them are sleeping out in the open ... You have to make calculations about whether a ceiling collapsing on you or being hit by shrapnel is more likely to happen.\"\\n\\nA U.N. World Food Programme representative said only one of two bakeries it had contracted to feed thousands of displaced families had fuel to make bread, \"and tomorrow there might be none\".\\n\\nU.S. STRIKES SYRIAN BASES USED BY IRANIAN PROXIES\\n\\nCalls for restraint stem not only from concern for Gaza\\'s civilians and Israeli hostages, but also fears that the crisis could spark conflict across the Middle East.\\n\\nU.S. President Joe Biden ordered overnight strikes on two Syrian bases used by Iran\\'s Revolutionary Guard Corps and militias that it backs, the Pentagon said, after issuing a rare direct warning to Iran on Thursday not to attack U.S. troops.\\n\\nU.S. and coalition troops have been attacked at least 19 times in Iraq and in Syria by Iranian-backed forces in the past week.\\n\\nIsrael says Hamas killed some 1,400 people including children in its Oct. 7 rampage.\\n\\nThe Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry said 7,326 Palestinians had been killed in the retaliatory air strikes, including around 3,000 children.\\n\\nBiden has cast doubt on casualty figures provided by Palestinian officials in Gaza, but international aid agencies say they are broadly accurate and have been reliable in the past.\\n\\nIn a poll in Israel\\'s Maariv newspaper, 49% of Israelis said \"it would be better to wait\" before beginning a large-scale ground offensive, while 29% disagreed. A week earlier, 65% had backed a ground invasion.\\n\\n\"It is almost certain that the developments on the matter of the hostages, which is now topping the agenda, have had a great impact on this shift,\" Maariv said.\\n\\nReporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi, Ahmed Mohamed Hassan, Tala Ramadan, Emily Rose, Adam Makary, Jeff Mason, Phil Stewart, Michelle Nichols, Gabriela Baczynska and Andrew Gray; Writing by Grant McCool, Michael Perry and Kevin Liffey; Editing by Cynthia Osterman, Simon Cameron-Moore and Raju Gopalakrishnan and Philippa Fletcher\\n\\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Grief has poured out across the region following the shocking slaughter of Wael Dahdouh’s wife and children in southern Gaza.\\n\\nMohammad Hussein has been glued to the television in recent weeks, watching Gaza’s destruction by Israeli air raids. And when an Israeli air raid killed the family of Al Jazeera Gaza Bureau Chief Wael Dahdouh on Wednesday, Hussein watched the story unfold.\\n\\n“It’s a crime,” the 45-year-old taxi driver said, his left hand fiddling with prayer beads as he sat on a busy throughway in Beirut. “[And a violation] of human rights.”\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the news broke that Dahdouh’s family was killed in an attack in southern Gaza. His family had fled northern Gaza to the south on Israel’s advice but were killed anyway.\\n\\nDahdouh lost his wife, a daughter, a grandson and a 15-year-old son who wanted to follow in his footsteps into journalism. They are among the more than 7,000 people killed – 3,000 of whom are children – in Gaza since the start of the hostilities. The images of Dahdouh entering the morgue and identifying his family members were widely carried on Al Jazeera Arabic.\\n\\n“It was shocking news,” said Maan Al-Haj Ali, a journalist working for Palestine’s WAFA News Agency. “As if [he] was a member of the family, as if someone very close was broken in front of you.”\\n\\n‘They seek revenge through your children’\\n\\nTo those in Gaza, Dahdouh’s presence on their screens has been a constant in recent years. Many in the media praised his work and expressed their sorrow that a man so used to covering the tragedies of others now had to face his own.\\n\\n“As a journalist and writer, Wael is a beacon of brave reporting and authentic journalism,” Mohammed R Mhawish, a Palestinian journalist and writer based in Gaza, told Al Jazeera. “I was listening to the live broadcast when he received the news of the killing of his family members. It shocked me to see him break down on screen.”\\n\\nThe attack came only a couple of weeks after US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken reportedly told Qatar’s emir to tone down Al Jazeera Arabic’s coverage of the war on Gaza. When he saw his slain family, Dahdouh was recorded saying, “They seek revenge through our children.”\\n\\n“The attack isn’t on Wael and his family only, but on the entire people of Gaza,” Ahmed al-Yazil, a student of media and mass communications in Gaza, said. “Israel attempts to shut Wael’s and every Palestinian’s voice trying to report on the reality of life under occupation and war. But it won’t succeed, even if we lost loved ones along the way.”\\n\\n‘Why are they targeting journalists?’\\n\\nThe news spread like wildfire on social networks. Users shared images of a distraught Dahdouh or a clip of the anchor who delivered the news nearly breaking down in tears.\\n\\n“My Instagram is filled with people sharing it since yesterday,” Aya Mhanna, 38, a Lebanese clinical psychologist now living in Istanbul, told Al Jazeera. Mhanna said she recognised Dahdouh from his reporting and lamented that the journalist had become the news. “It breaks my heart.”\\n\\nEven those who had not known his name before Wednesday said the story was on everyone’s lips. Abdulrahman Bashar Itani sat outside his shop in Beirut next to two other men. “I watch all the channels,” the sprightly 90-year-old said. “I didn’t see the news but everyone is talking about it.”\\n\\nItani also brought up Issam Abdallah, the Lebanese Reuters journalist killed in south Lebanon on October 13. “Haram,” he said. “Why are they targeting journalists?”\\n\\nAt least 24 journalists have been killed in the latest round of hostilities, including 20 Palestinians, three Israelis and Lebanon’s Abdallah.\\n\\nIn the West Bank, Palestinians have grown accustomed to Dahdouh’s presence and reporting on the decades-long occupation of Palestine and the genocide of its people. Respect and compassion have flowed as he reels from Israel’s killing of his family in the south of Gaza.\\n\\n“It is shameful for the people who … see our children, women and elderly being killed while they are sitting [by],” Ali, the WAFA journalist, said.\\n\\n‘As if the children of Palestine are worthless’\\n\\nAs the eyes of the world have turned to Gaza, Syria is also still suffering air raids, albeit from Russia. Nonetheless, many in Syria were also gripped by the news and took a minute to lend their solidarity.\\n\\n“The pain and sorrow felt by Wael were felt by all of us despite our distance from him,” Osman al-Khader, a lawyer and activist in the Syrian revolution, said. “Wael refused to do anything but give us a lesson in patience and courage.”\\n\\nThe Syrian journalist, Hanin al-Sayed, from Idlib, said the Israeli attack on Dahdouh’s family brought the killing last year of another stalwart Palestinian journalist to his mind.\\n\\n“He often reminds me of Shireen Abu Akleh, may she rest in peace,” al-Sayed said. He added that she was “the voice of truth that was killed by the Israeli army’s gunfire, which continues to kill children and women in plain view of the world”.\\n\\nDahdouh’s pain was evident for the world to see on Wednesday. Many around the region have condemned the continuing assault and attacks on civilians and the mounting death toll that has no immediate end in sight.\\n\\n“No one is offering anything to help,” Ali said. It is “as if the children of Palestine and the people of Palestine are worthless”.',\n",

The conflict between Israel and Hamas has now entered a new phase. In addition to the aerial attacks, Israel has also prepared for a ground offensive. In today's DNA, Zee News anchor Sourabh Raaj Jain analysed Israel's special plan to attack Hamas.\\n\\nOn Wednesday night, Israel unveiled its plans for a ground assault when Israeli Army tanks entered Northern Gaza. The Israeli Army released a video showing their tanks moving into the Gaza border, accompanied by armored vehicles in their convoy. Through its recent ground offensive in northern Gaza, Israel has unequivocally conveyed its commitment to maintaining the intensity of its conflict with Hamas, sending a clear message to the Arab nations.\\n\\nThis marks a significant development for Israel in its efforts to dismantle Hamas. While previously, the United States had discouraged Israel from conducting ground operations, Israel has now unequivocally signaled its unwavering determination to avenge the loss of its citizens and eradicate Hamas, irrespective of external pressures. Israel has already asked the people in Northern Gaza to evacuate, and they put tanks on the Gaza border. They are ready for a ground attack and called up reserve soldiers.\",\n",

       " {'articleBody': \"Two Dussehra rallies took place on Tuesday in Mumbai. One at Shivaji Park where Uddhav Thackeray spoke. The second one was at Azad Maidan where CM Eknath Shinde addressed his supporters.\\n\\nIn Shivaji Park, the crowd at Uddhav Thackeray's Dussehra rally was nowhere near expected.\\n\\nWhile the crowd wasn't humongous at Shiv Sena rally in Azad Maidan too, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde was flanked by a large group of elected representatives on the stage. These leaders were MLAs, MPs, and even the deputy chair of Maharashtra's Legislative Council.\\n\\nUddhav's fears\\n\\nUddhav Thackeray's speech for the Dussehra rally appeared to be written by a new writer this time. The buzz going around is that it was his son, Aaditya, who had a major role in deciding some of the key points that Uddhav raised in his address.\\n\\nHis direct attack on Adani, in relation the Dharavi Redevelopment Project, especially came as a surprise because the Thackeray's have had good connections with the business families. They are regulars at events hosted by the Ambanis and barely a few days ago when the Adani group secured the tender for the Dharavi redevelopment, Gautam Adani had visited Uddhav at his residence.\\n\\nSo what explains Thackeray's attack?\\n\\nOne reason could be that Uddhav wants to visibly align himself with what Rahul Gandhi has been saying for the last few years.\\n\\nAlso, Aaditya has opposed multiple development projects earlier too. For example, he was vocal in opposing the Carshed for Mumbai Metro at Aarey, in spite of his party being in the ruling alliance then.\\n\\n\\n\\nOver and above this though, Uddhav's speech exposed a fear that he has probably realized will soon come true. Thackeray in his speech spoke about how only a coalition government will be formed in the state.\\n\\nThis betrays that Uddhav knows he will never be able to get a majority or a large numbers of MLAs in his camp in future elections.\\n\\nMany who haven't followed Uddhav would consider the above statement as a case of the author reading too much into a standard political speech, but the truth is that this is probably is the first time when Uddhav has openly said so. Before this, he would always say that chief minister would be from his party and would rarely give any importance to coalition.\\n\\nUddhav also expressed his dissatisfaction with his own former party colleague, and now Speaker of Maharashtra Assembly, Rahul Narvekar. He accused Narvekar of purposely delaying the verdict on the disqualification plea.\\n\\nHe also focused on the Maratha reservation issue, and accused the BJP and Chief Minister for not acting on it on purpose.\\n\\nMeanehile, what was missing at Uddhav's rally was visible at Shinde's rally, Shinde was flanked by the same Shiv Sena leaders who were seen on the stage during Dussehra rallies when Balasaheb Thackeray would address them.\\n\\nShinde attacked Uddhav where he knew it would hurt the most. He spoke about corruption, and called Uddhav's government as 'Lena Bank'. On Uddhav's recent political statements and allies, Shinde said that he who has already joined hands with Congress and Samajwadi Party, can also ally with the AIMIM and hug Hamas.\\n\\nUddhav Thackeray, since he joined hands with Congress and Sharad Pawar, has managed to position himself as the next big leader for the minority community and has got a good following amongst them. Shinde pointed out the same in his speech.\\n\\nHe also put a full-stop to speculations that his government was in any danger and he being unhappy with Ajit Pawar's inclusion in it. On the contrary, he claimed that Pawar becoming a part of the government has strengthened him.\\n\\nShinde, also professed his confidence in PM Modi and claimed that BJP-Sena-NCP alliance will win 45 seats of the 48 in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. A figure close to what those on ground have been predicting.\\n\\nIn the run up to Dussehra, Shinde was accused of being soft on Uddhav, for not fighting for Shivaji Park and settling for Azad Maidan for his rally. But he explained that he is the CM of the state and he wouldn't take any step that will endanger the peace of the state and hence, he chose an alternative.\\n\\nIn the political theatre of Maharashtra, Tuesday's stage was put in Mumbai. In his act, Uddhav Thackeray's unexpected rhetoric revealed strategic shifts, possibly influenced by his son, Aaditya. Meanwhile, Eknath Shinde exuded the sense of being in control, all while countering Thackeray's narrative.\\n\\nThe stage is set, alliances forged, as Maharashtra walks into 2024 when it holds both the Parliamentary and Assembly elections.\",\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'October 27, 2023 02:16 pm | Updated 03:41 pm IST - Thiruvananthapuram\\n\\nCongress Working Committee (CWC) member Shashi Tharoor, MP, appeared to have put his party in an awkward spot by purportedly referring to Hamas as a terrorist organisation at the mammoth rally organised by the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) in Kozhikode on October 26, 2023 to proclaim solidarity with the Palestine cause.\\n\\nCongress leadership in Kerala was yet to react to the contentious usage, which drew onstage criticism from IUML leaders M.K. Muneer, MLA, and M.P. Abdussamad Samadani. Both termed their opposition to Israel’s expansionist policies in Gaza and the West Bank as “legitimate resistance.”\\n\\n(IUML is a staunch Congress ally and a prominent constituent in the United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition in Kerala.)\\n\\n‘Speech cherry-picked’\\n\\nOn October 27 (Friday), Mr. Tharoor denied the imputation. He said some quarters had cherry-picked his speech to inject parochial politics into a global humanitarian cause. He said the address was solidly and unequivocally pro-Palestine when viewed in its entirety.\\n\\nIUML national general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty, MLA, sought to end the row. He welcomed Mr. Tharoor’s clarification and said provincial politics had no bearing on the IUML’s decision to rally public opinion in favour of Palestine’s oppressed, starved, and terrorised people.\\n\\nHe said the IUML had invited Mr. Tharoor as the chief guest to the rally in recognition of his global experience and international stature. The IUML would defeat efforts to rob the pro-Palestine rally’s relevance, political message and sheen.\\n\\nCommunist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] State secretariat member M. Swaraj was bitingly critical of Mr. Tharoor’s speech.\\n\\nIn a Facebook post, Mr. Swaraj alleged that Mr. Tharoor had used the IUML’s public platform to relay his solidarity with Israel.\\n\\n“Mr. Tharoor appeared to imply somewhat reductively that the incendiary Palestine problem had its genesis in Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7. And the current genocidal attacks on the besieged people of Palestine were Israel’s legitimate response. Mr. Tharoor seemed pointedly disinclined to term Israel a terrorist nation”, wrote Mr. Swaraj.\\n\\nLeft independent legislator and a sharp critic of the IUML, K.T. Jaleel, MLA, said the IUML rally seemed to express solidarity with expansionist and imperialistic Israel and its backers instead of solidly rallying behind the tyrannised and terrorised people of Palestine.\\n\\nCPI(M) State secretary M. V. Govindan seemed to take a relatively softer line, given the party’s outreach to minority communities to whittle the electoral prospects of the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections and its empathy towards the anti-BJP INDIA bloc opposition partnership.\\n\\nMr. Govindan seemed reluctant to confront Mr. Tharoor by stating that the Congress leader had “explained.”\\n\\nMr. Govindan also seemed to pussyfoot around whether the party viewed Hamas as a terrorist outfit. He merely said the CPI(M) stance on the Palestine question was clear.\\n\\nLast week, Mr. Govindan had fielded the same question by stating that he would not elaborate on Hamas’s “class nature.”\\n\\n“I am not going to elaborate on the class nature of Hamas. The CPI(M) is concerned about the rights of the Palestinian people. Communists reckon them as an oppressed class and exiles in their land. A hostile Israel has hedged in Palestine from three sides. Palestinians have only the sea to flee to,” Mr. Govindan had said.\\n\\nSuresh Gopi’s support\\n\\nMr. Tharoor found some support in BJP leader Suresh Gopi, who termed Hamas a terrorist organisation inimical to the welfare of Palestinians. “Mr. Tharoor would not make an off-the-cuff statement”, Mr. Gopi said.\\n\\nBJP State president K. Surendran appeared to take a harsher line against Mr. Tharoor and the IUML. He called the rally an open display of support for Hamas, a terrorist outfit that massacred Israeli civilians.\\n\\n“Mr. Tharoor had no business attending the rally that went against the grain of India’s stance on the issue in the United Nations”, Mr. Surendran said.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'In March 2022, when the Congress ally Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) top leadership went into a huddle at Panakkad House in Malappuram to anoint Sadiq Ali Shihab Tangal as the new party chief succeeding his departed elder brother Sayyid Hyderali Shihab Tangal, there was only one non-IUML leader on the occasion: Shashi Tharoor.\\n\\nThe Congress Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram had gone to pay his last respects to Sayyid Hyderali Shihab Tangal, when the IUML leadership requested him to stay on as they went through the motion of handing over Sadiq Ali the reins of the party. It is rare for any party to allow an outsider to attend such a crucial, high-level meeting.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nLast November, when Tharoor undertook a tour of Malabar soon after he lost the high- profile contest against Mallikarjun Kharge for the Congress president’s post, he went to Panakkad and held discussion with Sadiq Ali Thangal before attending an interaction with students of the Hyderali Shihab Thangal Academy for Civil Services, an institution run by the Muslim League.\\n\\nTharoor, in many ways, shares a very cordial relationship with the Muslim League leadership. Hence his reference to Hamas as “terrorists”, in the context of its October 7 attacks on Israel, at a Palestine solidarity rally organised by the IUML in Kozhikode on Thursday surprised many despite the point that his views on Hamas are well known.\\n\\nNo one should underestimate the depth of concern among large sections of the Indian public about the ongoing violence & the dangers of it worsening. India is one of the handful of countries that maintains Ambassadors in both Israel & Palestine and enjoys good relations with both.… pic.twitter.com/yXeCbZ1eX0 — Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) October 27, 2023\\n\\nTharoor was among the first Congress leaders to call the Hamas attack a “terror” act. “There is never any excuse for terrorism and India must condemn it unreservedly. But there is no excuse for dehumanizing occupation either and that too must end. Both the Israeli people and the Palestinans deserve to live in peace, dignity and security in their own lands,” Tharoor had said in a post on X on October 8 even as the Congress officially refrained from using the word terror.\\n\\n“The Indian National Congress condemns the brutal attacks on the people of Israel. The Indian National Congress has always believed that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a life of self-respect, equality and dignity must be fulfilled only through a process of dialogue and negotiations while ensuring the legitimate national security interests of the Israeli people. Violence of any type never provides a solution and must stop,” Congress communication head Jairam Ramesh had said in a post on X on October 8.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTharoor was one of the leaders who had argued in the October 9 meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) that its resolution should condemn the Hamas attack on Israel, name the outfit and use the word terror.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThat Tharoor’s reiteration of Hamas as “terrorists” came at a pro-Palestine IUML rally in Kerala makes it more significant, politically. And it is not just the Muslim League. The mainstream political parties in Kerala across the political divide have traditionally backed the Palestinian cause and often slammed Israel for its “aggression”.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHowever, despite speaking his mind, Tharoor, the diplomat-turned-politician, was cautious. He made it a point at the IUML rally to argue that the conflict in the Middle-East should not be framed as a “Muslim issue”, rather it was a matter of “human rights.”\\n\\nHe also condemned the bombing of Gaza by Israel. In fact, he called both the attacks — by Hamas on Israel, and by Israel on Gaza — as acts of terrorism.\\n\\nSenior Muslim League leader M K Muneer, speaking after Tharoor, repeated his party’s line that the fight of Palestinians was nothing less than a freedom struggle and “we should be able to differentiate between defence and attack”.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTharoor and the IUML may agree to disagree but the point that the IUML invited Tharoor as the keynote speaker at the event despite his pronounced views on the issue reflected the bond between the Congress leader and the Muslim League leadership.\\n\\nIt is to be seen whether Tharoor’s rivals in the Congress in Kerala – and there are many – would use his Hamas remark to target him again.\\n\\nInterestingly, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had mentioned Hamas in his first statement on the raging war a few days ago but he too had chosen not to use the word terrorism. He said the Congress had “condemned the brutal attacks by Hamas on the people of Israel” and argued “also unacceptable are the indiscriminate actions by Israel’s military forces in civilian areas, that includes a siege of the Gaza Strip and bombings in it”.\\n\\nCongress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra too slammed Israel on Friday. In a post on X, she said that even after the killing of 7,000 people in Gaza, the cycle of bloodshed and violence has not stopped. Out of these 7,000 people, 3,000 were innocent children, she noted.\\n\\n“There is no international law that has not been trampled upon. There is no such limit which has not been crossed. There is no such rule which has not been flouted…When will humanity wake up? After losing how many lives. After sacrificing how many children. Does the consciousness of being human remain? Did it ever exist?” Priyanka stated.',\n",

But the children at Gaza now say that they were now offering namaz not five times a day, but six times. The children say every day they have ‘janaza’ (funeral prayer).

       " {'articleBody': 'In a normal year, Diwali is the time for a sales boom, and salary bonus and gifts for the workers, in diamond hub Surat. But this year, thousands of skilled diamond polishers engaged in the business are staring at a gloomy picture and a possible salary cut. This is because of a slowdown in business primarily due to conflicts abroad, first the Russia-Ukraine war and then the Israel-Hamas war, according to diamond traders.\\n\\nWith the supply chain from the mining to the diamond market hit, Harshad Sanghani (36), who migrated from Amreli district to Surat 15 years ago to become a diamond polisher, said he is not sure if his employer will reopen his factory in Katargam after Diwali.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDiwali to Christmas marks the peak sales period for diamond business, but this year the diamond units are saddled with a large unsold inventory, with a slowdown in the biggest markets – the US and China. Diamond businessmen are not sure if they can give Diwali bonuses and some have reduced working hours to five days a week.\\n\\nLast month, the national Gems & Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), in a letter to the industry, appealed for a freeze on import of rough diamonds from October 15 to December 15, given the large inventories of unsold finished diamonds.\\n\\nOne of Surat’s top diamond manufacturers, Hari Krishna Exports, which claims to have more than 8,000 “skilled assets” and is famous for giving away flats, cars, scooters and jewellery to its employees on Diwali, has not planned any gifts this year.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIts promoter Savji Dholakia told The Indian Express, “Business is not doing well this year. We have not witnessed such a recession in the diamond industry. The diamond factory owners are somehow running the factories in survival mode, their capital jammed, trying to maintain the brand image of the company. Every year, we give gifts during Diwali, this year there will be no gifts on Diwali to diamond polishers.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWith uncertainty looming, Sanghani, who earns Rs 25,000 a month from polishing diamonds, said his wife has taken up a job of embellishing saris. She gets Rs 10 for every embellished sari. The couple have three school-going children.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“We had a good Diwali last year. This year, the industry is not doing well and we also understand the situation of factory owners. We are getting less salary and to run a family of three school-going children, and also to pay the house rent, it is difficult. We are also not sure if our factory will reopen after Diwali. I have started looking for jobs in another sector in Surat. If nothing goes well, I will return to my native place and start farming,” said Sanghani.\\n\\nSurat has nearly 5,000 diamond units employing over 6 lakh workers, and polishes 8 of 10 diamonds in the world. The unit owners and polishers hail from different villages in Saurashtra and north Gujarat and are settled in Surat. Some of the Surat manufacturers also outsource polishing work to artisans in Bhavnagar and Amreli districts.\\n\\nMumbai’s Bharat Diamond Bourse continues to be the trading hub, although the soon-to-open Surat Diamond Bourse may offload some of its trading volume.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe downslide began after the US imposed sanctions on one of the biggest diamond miners, Alrosa, in Russia in April last year, after it went to war with Ukraine. And just when the diamond industry was exploring new markets in smaller countries of the Far East like Cambodia, Vietnam and the countries of the Gulf Co-operation Council late September, the Israel-Hamas war broke out, raising concerns. Although small, Israel is a market for diamonds exported from Surat.\\n\\nWith the slowdown in the US and China markets, the GJEPC on September 29 organised a two-day international Buyer Seller Meet for gems and jewellery in Mumbai, which was attended by over 30 buyers from countries such as the UAE, Egypt, China, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Panama and US.\\n\\nGJEPC Chairman Vipul Shah said, “The gem and jewellery industry has encountered its fair share of difficulties in recent times, primarily due to decreased demand caused by global economic downturns and geopolitical instability. Nevertheless, we are dedicated to enhancing exports by exploring new markets and hosting such events that allow us to engage with buyers, gaining insights into their current preferences and trends in gems and jewellery in their markets.”\\n\\nData from GJEPC shows the overall gross exports of cut and polished diamonds fell by 9.78 % in the financial year ending March 2023, while imports of rough diamonds fell by 8.42 %, compared to the previous financial year. Gross imports from April 2023 to September 2023 fell by 20.81 % compared to the corresponding period last year. The exports of finished diamonds show a decline of 28.76 % in the same period this year.\\n\\nIn Surat, Rakesh Patodiya (60), owner of Vaishali gems at Katargam, which employs 500 diamond polishers, said his business went down by “50 per cent”.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“We sell polished diamonds in the local market and also export to the US, China, Middle East among others. We are not seeing good signs in upcoming months due to the geopolitical conditions,” he said.\\n\\n“After the Covid pandemic, the market of polished diamonds surged till 2022 and with the starting of this year, the market started collapsing and now it has reached to such an extent that the diamond factory owners are struggling for their survival. The factory owners have adopted different means to maintain their image in the market,” Patodiya said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“Last year, we gave one month’s salary as bonus to our employees and this year we are not in a position to even give them their full salary and our employees are aware of this.”\\n\\nSurat Diamond Association president Jagdish Khunt said: “We have not seen such a recession in the history of the diamond industry.”\\n\\n“In the present situation, we have requested the diamond factories of Surat to continue their production till Diwali. We have come to know that many factories have cut short their production and some of them have also kept two days holidays in a week to survive in the present situation. It is a collective effort as diamond factory owners and diamond workers should also understand the complex situation.”',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Dear Express Reader,\\n\\nThe allegations against Trinamool Congress MP from Krishnanagar, Mahua Moitra, are certainly serious. She is accused of taking cash and expensive gifts from a businessman, Darshan Hiranandani, with whom she allegedly shared her Parliament login and password, for asking questions in the House. The matter is with the Ethics Committee of Lok Sabha, and there are several steps to go before guilt or innocence can be proved or disproved.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnd yet, you might ask, is anyone really waiting for the verdict that will come after the due process of law plays out in full. Is the truth, or untruth, of the allegations against MP Moitra — whose party, by the way, appears to have abandoned her to face them alone — at the heart of this matter?\\n\\nIn times of social media, and with an important set of elections round the corner, the “cash-for-query” case has already achieved two things it arguably intended to — it has thrown a large question mark at an articulate member of the Opposition who may be a political lightweight but who has stood up in Parliament, again and again, to ask questions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the House of Adani. And in so doing, it has underlined, ahead of an electoral campaign for five states, an opposition that the BJP has vigorously sought to paint and project for some time — of Modi versus Them, the latter category comprising those who are in the dock, from Rahul Gandhi, who nearly lost his membership of Parliament to a conviction in a criminal defamation case, to the AAP’s arrested trio, Satyendra Jain, Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh, to the now-embattled MP of the TMC.\\n\\nThe impatience with and disregard for the process of justice that is visible in the Moitra case cannot just be attributed to an older syndrome comprising people’s short attention spans and parties’ smear campaigns shifting the onus of proving their innocence on to the accused. It is compounded by at least two more recent factors: The first is a dominant player like the BJP, which nurtures an abiding sense of siege and casts itself in the role of righteous insurgent.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe BJP bears a deep grudge against the System and its institutions and norms that it felt shut out of for the decades the Congress presided over it. It is now armed with both the power and the drive to knock them down and recreate them in its Leader’s interest and image. This combines with the second factor — the waning credibility of almost all mediating institutions that could have salvaged less-hijackable notions of truth and upheld impersonal norms in the space between Leader and the people.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt did not need the Modi government slamming a case under the stringent anti-terror law, UAPA, against a news portal to draw attention to just how vulnerable a place the “media” as a whole finds itself in today — not only can it be targeted by a power-drunk government, it also finds it increasingly difficult to access, in its defence, an institutional cache of goodwill and credibility built over decades.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe latter has been eroded partly because of the past and present abdications of a section of the media itself, and partly because of the multiple onslaughts on it in the present social media age. A competition has been set up, on an unlevel playing field, between journalism and its more eye-catching and much more polarising hit-and-run variant. The media’s authority and truth-telling has been displaced by a noisy, anything-goes battle of narratives.\\n\\nIn this scenario, it is not just Moitra who stands the risk of being judged many times over before she has a chance to argue her case. As election campaigns get going on the ground, important issues — from Israel vs Palestine, to the Supreme Court’s marriage equality verdict at home most recently — are also likely to get cavalier treatment.\\n\\nThese are complex issues — there are victims and villains, more victims than villains, on both sides of the divide in the tortured and prolonged confrontation between Israel and Palestine, and there can be no excuse for using the conflict for minority-baiting at home. The Court withholding recognition to same-sex marriage raises complicated questions about social and constitutional morality, and the lag between the two.\\n\\nBut the ability of society and polity to navigate thorny issues is being severely compromised by the potent combination of a ruling party that calls on both to only trust and follow the Leader, whom it puts at the centre of every denuded frame, and the depleted capacity, for now, of the mediating and countervailing institutions that could have invited and hosted a wider and more open-ended conversation and debate.\\n\\nTill next week,\\n\\nVandita\\n\\nMust Read Opinions from the week\\n\\n– Shreya Shree, “It’s not just nine months”, October 17\\n\\n– Pratap Bhanu Mehta, “Court stops short”, October 18\\n\\n– Harish Damodaran, “Revolution and its sutradhar”, October 19\\n\\n– EP Unny, “The cartoon hurts more”, October 20\\n\\n– Suhas Palshikar, “Caste census plus”, October 20',\n",

India exported $1,279.76 million worth of diamonds to Israel during 2022-23. Israel, a major trading hub, exports raw diamonds worth $1,782.80 million. However, since the Russia-Ukraine war began, there has been a lack of rough diamonds (a vital raw material for diamond processing) in Surat. According to the Diamond Workers’ Association, diamond traders have stopped importing rough diamonds for the next two months, which will trigger a rise in unemployment. Ramesh Jilaria, president of the Gujarat Diamond Workers Association, said first it was the Ukraine war that affected the diamond industry. “The Israel-Palestine conflict has delivered a double blow, resulting in job losses to 30,000 artisans across Gujarat,” he said.ADVERTISEMENTgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1576647220-9\");}); “Each year, as Diwali approaches, diamond manufacturing units are usually open for 24 hours, but this time diamond workers are getting work for up to 10 hours. Many factories have begun offering a two-day off per week. Due to a scarcity of diamonds and raw material, many small units in Surat have declared an early Diwali vacation,” says Jilaria. Bhavesh Tank, vice-president of the Gujarat Diamond Workers’ Association, said at the moment, at least 400 diamond factories have shuttered, and 30 workers have committed suicide in Surat alone in the last five months due to factory closures. “In Surat, there are approximately 8 lakh artisans working in the diamond industry, on which approximately at least 4 lakh families depend. If the war continues, thousands of people will lose their jobs in the next few days. We have demanded an assistance package from the state government,” he said. The association has also written to Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal. 30 suicides in 5 months The war in Israel is the second blow to Surat’s diamond trade after the Ukraine war. The Gujarat Diamond Workers’ Association says 30 workers have committed suicide in the city in about five months due to economic hardships. India exported $1,279.76 million worth of diamonds to Israel during 2022-23. Israel, a major trading hub, exports raw diamonds worth $1,782.80 million.

       " {'articleBody': \"India’s strong, if unremarkable, relationship with Qatar may be in for a rough spell after a court in the Arab country sentenced eight Indian naval veterans to death. While Qatar has not made the charges public, media reports indicate that the men were held for espionage. Mint looks at the case and its implications for India-Qatar ties.\\n\\nCase background\\n\\nIn August 2022, eight former naval veterans were arrested by Qatar and held in solitary confinement. No clear charges or reasons for their arrest were made public. The men were employees of Al Dahra, a consulting firm working with Qatar’s military. Media reports, citing government and intelligence sources, say that the eight men were arrested on charges of espionage. The trial began in March this year and on Thursday, India’s Ministry of External Affairs said that a Qatari court had sentenced the eight men to death.\\n\\nIndia-Qatar relations: A snapshot\\n\\nHistorically, India and Qatar have enjoyed a favourable relationship. Energy, especially liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from Qatar to India, is a significant component of their trade relationship, which was valued at $5 billion in 2021-22. Investment avenues have always been open, with Qatar investing $1 billion in Reliance Retail and its FDI in India growing five times since 2020. Defence is another key area, marked by India offering training to Qatari forces and a defence cooperation agreement signed in 2008. Qatar is also home to 844,499 Indian workers. High-level visits from leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, vice presidents Dhankar and Naidu, and external affairs minister S Jaishankar further emphasize the closeness.\\n\\nIndia's reaction\\n\\nIndia's response to the verdict has been measured. The country’s leadership has refrained from publicizing the issue or criticizing Qatar overtly. New Delhi has consistently stressed the importance of the well-being of the detained men, ensuring it doesn't appear as intervention in Qatar’s legal affairs. The Indian Foreign Ministry’s official response has been subdued, saying that they will continue liaising with Qatari officials and support the affected families. Some experts suggest that India might work towards a governmental resolution for the detainees. It's been noted that earlier attempts by Indian intelligence to convince Qatari security about the detainees' innocence weren't successful.\\n\\nPotential impact on bilateral relations\\n\\nIt's uncertain how this will influence India-Qatar ties. India's restrained approach suggests it's cautious about affecting its economic and energy ties with Qatar. However, this stance might be tested if there's a significant domestic uproar in India over the issue. A significant twist, as reported by ThePrint, claims the detained men were suspected of relaying information about Qatar’s classified submarine project to Israel. This revelation, if true, could complicate matters, especially considering concerns that Qatar might share its submarine tech with Pakistan, a close ally.\",\n",

Given his wide audience around the world, thanks to YouTube, it is not surprising that he got a mark painted behind his back.\\n\\nThis trial, however, has only brought to surface the unnoticed politics of Khalistan being played out in gurdwaras and New Zealand’s Sikh community.\\n\\nJust four days earlier, the Sikh Press Association, a Khalistani propaganda site, put out a release about New Zealand Sikhs demanding a “formal independent investigation” by the New Zealand government into Indian interference in the country.\\n\\nThis call for the demand, reported from an assembly of 200 people at Gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib in Auckland, saw representatives of New Zealand Sikh Youth, Sikh Aspirations and Gurdwara sevadaars gather, with virtual appearances by Canadian speakers, British Columbia Gurdwaras Council spokesperson Bhai Moninder Singh, and legal advocate Bhai Prabjot Singh, editor of Panth Punjab.\\n\\nIn April this year, there was news of the arrest of Baltej Singh (nephew of Satwant Singh, one of Indira Gandhi’s assassins). He was arrested as part of a drug racket bust carried out by the Auckland Police.\\n\\nBaltej Singh was allegedly known to have been involved in pro-Khalistan activities in New Zealand, and had amassed huge amounts of wealth through drug peddling.\\n\\nMeanwhile, propaganda flows unabated in New Zealand about \"Hindutva terror.\"\\n\\nA story by Ripu Bhatia from earlier this year talked about Sikhs ‘afraid’ to go back to India, claiming they are becoming marginalised by the “Hindu-centric rhetoric and policies” of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\\n\\nIt is ironic, though, that the reason for fear is supporting Dubai-based truck business owner who has turned into an extremist and secession advocate, Amritpal Singh Sandhu, with the fear of getting blacklisted by Indian authorities.\\n\\nWhile the story was full of unsubstantiated claims, it was fascinating to see how the quoted person was a spokesperson for Waris Punjab De, Amritpal Singh Sandhu’s organisation.\\n\\nIn fact, a month prior to this story, a protest had been carried out in Auckland against the arrest of Amritpal Sandhu in Aotearoa.\\n\\nOf course, this is not new. The politics of Khalistan in gurdwaras of New Zealand is common.\\n\\nVideos can be seen of gurdwaras across New Zealand where pictures of Khalistani militants and Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale gloriously adorn walls, with some pictures even bigger than that of historical figures like Baba Deep Singh.\\n\\nFor instance, in Gurdwara Kalgidhar Sahib in Takanini, which has one of the largest Sikh populations outside Auckland, one can see pictures of Bhindranwale, Satwant Singh, Gurdev Singh Kounke, and Harjinder Singh Jinda among others.',\n",

They were arrested by Qatari authorities on August 30, 2022 and have since been under solitary confinement. Their trial began on March 29 this year.\\n\\nThe Ministry of External Affairs said on Thursday (October 26) that it was “deeply shocked by the verdict of death penalty” and was “awaiting the detailed judgement”. The Ministry also said that it was “exploring all legal options”.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe reasons for the veterans’ long custody in Qatar, and the awarding of the death penalty, are not in the public domain. The families of the veterans were not apprised of the formal charges under which the trial was being held. The case presents a significant diplomatic challenge for the Indian government.\\n\\nWho are these Indians, and what were they doing in Qatar?\\n\\nThe eight former Navy personnel — Captain Navtej Singh Gill, Captain Saurabh Vasisht, Commander Purnendu Tiwari, Captain Birendra Kumar Verma, Commander Sugunakar Pakala, Commander Sanjeev Gupta, Commander Amit Nagpal and Sailor Ragesh — were working at Al Dahra Global Technologies and Consultancy Services, a defence services provider company.\\n\\nThe company is owned by an Omani national, Khamis al-Ajmi, a retired squadron leader of the Royal Oman Air Force. This man too, was arrested along with the eight Indians, but he was released in November 2022.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe company’s old website, which no longer exists, said it provided training, logistics and maintenance services to the Qatari Emiri Naval Force (QENF). On its new website, the company is called Dahra Global, but there is no mention of the connection to the QENF, nor of the seven former Navy officers who had leadership roles in the company.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCommander Purnendu Tiwari (retd), who was Managing Director of the company, received the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman in 2019 for his services in furthering the bilateral relationship between India and Qatar. He was feted in Doha by then Indian Ambassador P Kumaran, and a former head of the Qatar defence forces’ International Military Cooperation. The function was held at the Indian Cultural Centre. Captain Kapil Kaushik of the Indian Navy, who was the defence attache at Embassy of India at the time, was present at this event.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe Dahra website had certificates from Kumaran, and his successor at the Indian Embassy in Doha, Ambassador Deepak Mittal, praising the company’s work as furthering the cause of good relations between the two countries. Most of the arrested men had been working at Dahra for four to six years at the time of their arrests.\\n\\nWhen were the men arrested by the Qatari authorities, and why?\\n\\nThe men were picked up by the State Security Bureau, the Qatari intelligence agency. The Indian Embassy first learnt about the arrests in mid-September last year.\\n\\nOn September 30, the men were allowed “brief telephonic contact” with their family members. The first consular access — a visit by an official of the Indian embassy — was granted on October 3, more than a month after they were taken into custody.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFor the next few months at least, they were allowed weekly phone calls to their family members.\\n\\nThe charges against the men were never made public, but the fact they were put in solitary confinement led to speculation that they had been detained in connection with a security-related offence.\\n\\nWhat is the nature of the relationship between India and Qatar?\\n\\nThe two countries have had friendly relations for decades. Since Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s visit to Qatar in November 2008, the first by an Indian Prime Minister, the relationship has burgeoned.\\n\\nThe Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, visited India in 2015, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi went to Qatar in 2016. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has visited the country on at least three occasions. The late Sushma Swaraj became the first Indian Foreign Minister to visit Qatar in 2018.\\n\\nIn 2021, India was among the top four export destinations for Qatar; it is also among the top three sources of Qatar’s imports. The bilateral trade is valued at $15 billion, which is mostly LNG and LPG exports from Qatar worth over $13 billion.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDefence co-operation has been officially described as a “pillar” of Indian-Qatar ties. The India-Qatar Defence Cooperation Agreement, signed during Prime Minister Singh’s November 2008 visit, was a significant turning point. The agreement was extended for another five years in 2018.\\n\\nA paper published by the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) at the time quoted reports of Indian officials describing the agreement as “just short of stationing troops”. The pact included training of the QENF by India, as well as mutual visits.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIndian Naval and Coast Guard ships regularly visit Qatar. QENF delegations participated in two maritime exercises in India in 2021. Two editions of a joint naval exercise called Zair Al Bahr have been held.\\n\\nWhat are the challenges, if any, in the relationship?\\n\\nThe first big challenge to the relationship came in June 2022 over BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma’s derogatory references to the Prophet on a TV show.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMust Read | Explained: Why the Gulf matters for India\\n\\nQatar was the first country to object, and demand a “public apology” from India soon after the controversy erupted. The Indian Ambassador was summoned for a dressing down. India’s damage control by getting the BJP to sack Sharma prompltly as outrage spread across the Islamic world, contained the fallout.\\n\\nThe jailing of the eight ex-Navy personnel is the second big challenge of recent years. The development blindsided New Delhi in a country where 800,000 Indians live and work. Indians are the largest expatriate community in Qatar. Its 210-strong delegation at the Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas event in Indore last year was the second biggest, next only to the Mauritius delegation.\\n\\nThe news of the death penalty for the Indians has come at time when the Middle East is on the boil over the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.

He is a staunch Congress supporter. He is a companion of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Narasimha Rao and others. However, do not insist that certain truths should not be told. Those in Palestine are also humans. All war and killing must end.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo terrorist should reign here and remain. I said it as a human being and not as a BJP activist. Don’t put this in the heads of the BJP, Congress and the Muslim League. It is the opinion of the people. It is enough to understand that people are spreading the truth that they see and understand with their hearts,' said Suresh Gopi.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeantime, P K Kunhalikutty said that no one should try to twist the words of the leaders in the rally. Kunhalikutty clarified that Shashi Tharoor's participation in the Kozhikode rally was to get international attention and the rally had a big purpose.\\n\\n\\n\\n'Don't try to twist the words of the speech. There are some centers who are trying to do that. We have understood who they are. Holding a rally like this is not easy. The Muslim League managed to conduct a serious matter with discipline. The rally was widely discussed. Even the international media took over and it will not end with one rally. The issue is solidarity with Palestine. Anyone who speaks against this will be cruel to a nation.\\n\\nTharoor said that he is with Palestine. There is no need to make it an issue. He will give another explanation. Don't just stick to one line and try to eliminate the Palestinian issue. Everyone including M K Muneer and Samadhani said Muslim League's stand on the issue. There is not much more to say about it,' added Kunhalikutty.\",\n",

Addressing an event organised to express solidarity with the Palestine people by the Indian United Muslim League (IUML) in Kerala\\'s Kozhikode on Thursday, Tharoor urged Israel to end air strikes in Gaza adding that India has always stood for peace since Mahatama Gandhi. \"Since 19 days, the world has seen the worst human-rights tragedies. We are seeing the worst tragedy. Terrorists attacked Israel, Hamas is a terror group. Israel stopped providing food, water and electricity to Gaza. We are condemning the bombing of Israel,\" Tharoor said at the event held at Kozhikode beach. Tharoor, who had previoulsy served as a UN diplomat said the ongoing air strikes in Gaza by Israel in response to the Hamas attack was \"disproportionate.\" Reiterating Bapu\\'s words, Tharoor said, \"An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind. India has always stood for peace since Gandhi.\"ADVERTISEMENTgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1576647220-9\");}); He also highlighted that the ongoing crisis is not a Muslim issue but a human rights issue and said \"war knows no religion.\" \"Israel calls their operation, \\'Swords of Iron\\', but now those swords are dipped in the blood of children. The bombing has caused a lot of injuries and innocent people are suffering and they are dying. Many are living under suffocating occupation,\" Tharoor said. He said that over 6,000 Palestinians and 300 Israelis were killed in clashes in the area between 2008 and September this year and the number of those who died since October 7, however, was much more. \"While 1,400 Israelis died in the Hamas terrorist attack, many more were killed in Gaza when Israel responded to it.....Innocent civilians are dying,\" Tharoor said. Tharoor urged Israel to end the war and further appealed to the world to unite to \"end the human rights violations inflicted on the Palestinian people\". \"Now, it is more than time to announce a ceasefire,\" the Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram said. While addressing the rally, IUML national general secretary PK Kunhalikutty said that the biggest weapon in the world is public opinion and that showing solidarity will bring results. \"Children are dying. We all are here to shed tears for the brutality in Gaza. We have no weapons to send there or save them. This rally will yield fruit because the biggest weapon in the world is public opinion. Global leaders are joining in solidarity. That\\'s how we also joined this. Solidarity has made results here. Killings should stop in Palestine,\" he said. IUML Party workers gathered in strength for Thursday\\'s rally, which was presided over by Kunhalikutty with Shashi Tharoor as Chief Guest. IUML state president Panakkad Sayyid Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal inaugurated the rally. In his speech, Thangal said \"Israel\\'s occupation has created Palestine conflict. They are trying to survive. They are trying the defend their land. Stop genocide killings. This conflict has started since 1947. Gandhi criticised Israeli occupation. Nehru, Manmohan Singh, even Vajpayee also took a stand against the Israeli occupation of Palestine... They all stood with justice.

       " {'articleBody': 'New York: In a strongly worded message, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has delivered a significant warning to Iran, vowing that the United States would respond with unwavering determination if Iran or its proxies were to attack American personnel. This comes as the Joe Biden administration works to prevent Iran from becoming involved in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Blinken addressed the United Nations Security Council, making it clear that the United States aims to avoid conflict with Iran and does not desire an escalation of the conflict. However, he emphasized that any attack by Iran or its proxies on US personnel would prompt an immediate and decisive response.\\n\\nHe also called upon other nations, including Russia and China, who are part of the 15-member Security Council, to dissuade Iran from opening a new front against Israel or attacking its allies. Furthermore, he stressed the need to hold Iran accountable should such actions occur.\\n\\nHamas Vs LeT\\n\\nIn his address, Blinken drew a parallel between the actions of Hamas in Israel and the Pakistan-based terror organization Lashkar-e-Taiba. He underscored that all acts of terrorism, whether targeting people in different parts of the world, are \"unlawful and unjustifiable.\"\\n\\nThe Secretary of State stressed the Security Council\\'s duty to condemn nations providing support to terrorist groups in the form of arming, funding, or training. This appeal was notably referencing the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba, resulting in the loss of 166 lives, including six Americans.\\n\\nHumanitarian Pauses In Gaza War\\n\\nBlinken also called for \"humanitarian pauses\" in the Gaza conflict to protect Palestinian civilians. This falls short of a ceasefire, which the US has refrained from endorsing, in order to ensure Israel\\'s right to respond to the October 7 attack on Hamas.\\n\\nHe criticized the international community for failing to explicitly condemn the October 7 Hamas attack, highlighting the importance of world leaders acknowledging the right and responsibility to respond to terror attacks against their citizens.\\n\\nIsrael\\'s Call For UN Chief’s Resignation\\n\\nIn a separate development, Israel has demanded the resignation of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres following his comments regarding the Israeli counteroffensive in Gaza. The Israeli envoy to the UN, Gilad Erdan, deemed Guterres \"unfit\" to lead the UN and called for his resignation.\\n\\nThis demand came after Guterres stated that the attacks by Hamas could not justify the \"collective punishment of the Palestinian people,\" citing the decades of occupation, settlement expansion, and violence endured by the Palestinian population.\\n\\nHumanitarian Crisis In Gaza\\n\\nThe Ministry of Health in Gaza reported a dire situation, with over 5,000 Palestinians killed, including a significant number of children, women, journalists, medical workers, and first responders. Additionally, over 15,000 people have been injured, highlighting the severity of the humanitarian crisis in the region.',\n",

Yonatan Tzur, the commander of the Nahal Brigade\\'s patrol battalion, who was later tragically killed in an encounter with terrorists.

It was apparent that most of the combatants were in the dining room, armed with anti-tank missiles. It became clear that this was not a typical terrorist infiltration.\\n\\nApproaching the base from all angles, they identified at least seven terrorists, and more from the nearby dirt embankment were starting to climb up. Suddenly, a convoy with almost 50 terrorists and snipers charged toward the squad of 12 at breakneck speed. They responded with gunfire. Terrorists were eliminated, and the others dispersed.\\n\\nIn a harrowing moment, a terrorist advanced on Ben-Yehuda at point-blank range, but her quick reaction saved her from harm. Advertisement\\n\\nLt.-Col. A from the Magic Touch Squadron (190) arrived and identified the terrorists inside the base. He suggested taking action but Ben-Yehuda insisted on avoiding harm to the soldiers inside. Instead, bursts of fire were directed at the surrounding earthen embankments, killing terrorists and preventing further attacks on the squad.\\n\\nFor nearly four hours, terrorists attempted to outflank Ben-Yehuda and her team, engaging them in firefights. More vans arrived, but the Caracal Battalion commander effectively thwarted them. Additional Light Anti-Armor Weapon (LAW) missiles were launched, further eliminating terrorists: Some were killed, and others retreated.\\n\\nDespite wounds to some of her soldiers, they persevered.\\n\\nAfter hours of intense combat, soldiers from the Shayetet (flotilla) 13 Navy Special Forces unit arrived to clear the base of terrorists. Drones were launched to assist them. The firefights continued, and wounded soldiers were evacuated. They remained at the base for a total of 14 hours until it was fully secured.

Their remarkable performance under the extreme pressure of war highlighted their capabilities.\\n\\nShe also acknowledged the tank soldiers under her command, who played a vital role in defending towns and decisively impacting the battle in Holit, a kibbutz near the southwestern-most border of the Gaza Strip where at least 11 of its members were killed along with two migrant workers.\\n\\nIn total, her battalion eliminated around 100 terrorists. She hopes this serves as proof that there should be no more doubts about female combat soldiers. \"Their training and performance on the battlefield have erased any doubts.

       " {'articleBody': 'Recent efforts to de-escalate tensions between the West and Iran over Tehran’s nuclear program have been set back by the recent Hamas terror attack on Israel, and Iran could seek to use the atomic program as leverage, according to analysts.\\n\\nWestern powers accuse Iran of supporting Hamas as a proxy militant group in the region, although they have not accused Tehran of direct involvement in the group’s October 7 cross-border terror attack on Israel, which killed more than 1,400 Israeli soldiers and civilians. Hamas is also holding more than 200 people hostage.\\n\\nIsrael’s subsequent bombing of Hamas targets in Gaza had killed almost 6,500 people as of Wednesday, according to Palestinian health officials, including more than 2,700 children.\\n\\nPrior to the Hamas attack, relations between the West and Iran appeared to be cautiously improving. In September, the United States agreed on a prisoner swap with Tehran, brokered by Qatar. Five prisoners were exchanged on each side and Washington agreed to release $6 billion of frozen Iranian assets. The U.S. refroze that money following the attack by Hamas, which Washington has designated as a terrorist group.\\n\\n“It was widely expected that after the detainee deal between Iran and the United States - and the de-escalatory understanding that the two countries had, which had brought about a much calmer context - that there was room for direct negotiations towards the end of October between Iran and the U.S., in Oman,” said Ali Vaez, Iran Project director at the International Crisis Group in Washington. “But that, I think, is now completely off the books, and there is probably no political space left for direct engagement between the two countries.\"\\n\\nWhether there is engagement or not, Vaez continued, “the Iranian nuclear issue remains a major crisis, and I think the last thing that the Biden administration needs in the coming year, as it deals with the war between Israel and Hamas and the war in Ukraine, is a nuclear crisis in the Middle East.”\\n\\nFuture engagement\\n\\nU.S. President Joe Biden is unlikely to seek further engagement with Iran on the nuclear program, according to Peter Jenkins, a former British ambassador to the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA.\\n\\n“If Iran gets blamed, at least in part, for those [Hamas] attacks because those militias are considered to be Iran-backed, then I find it very hard to imagine that the Biden administration would want to expose itself to attack from the public or especially from Republicans in Congress and from Israel, or from Israeli lobbies like AIPAC, by opening negotiations with Iran,” Jenkins told VOA.\\n\\nAIPAC is the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a bipartisan, pro-Israel political action committee and lobbying group.\\n\\nIran is also unlikely to seek further talks, he added. “The current Iranian administration is not an enthusiast for the JCPOA. And what\\'s just happened is that the United States has refrozen $6 billion - belonging to Iran, but long frozen - which the Biden administration had promised, pledged to unfreeze in return for the release of hostages. I assume that in Tehran people are feeling rather incensed about that,” Jenkins told VOA.\\n\\nHe was referring to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\\n\\nThe West should not treat the Iranian nuclear threat in isolation from other concerns such as Tehran’s support for militant proxies like Hamas, argued Behnam Ben Taleblu, an analyst with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington.\\n\\n\"For me, the concern is a larger picture of both sides of the Atlantic disconnecting the dots between the patron [Iran] and proxy problem and between the politics of the major Iran issue of the day: the JCPOA, the general issue of sanctions relief, and the more localized nature of the conflict. I think this disconnecting the dots is unhelpful to seeing the bigger picture as it\\'s quite literally now unfolding in Gaza and in Israel,” Taleblu told VOA.\\n\\nJCPOA talks\\n\\nTalks in Vienna to revive the nuclear deal stalled last year, although neither side has said the negotiations are officially finished.\\n\\nThen-U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the JCPOA in 2018, saying it had failed to halt Iran’s enrichment activities or curb its missile program and support for militant proxies in the region.\\n\\nTehran stopped complying with its commitments under the JCPOA soon afterward and removed the IAEA monitoring equipment in June 2022 while blocking some nuclear inspectors from visiting the country.\\n\\nThe IAEA said in its latest report published in August that Iran was continuing to enrich uranium up to 60 percent purity, short of 90 percent weapons-grade fuel.\\n\\n“Iran’s decision to remove all of the agency’s equipment previously installed in Iran for JCPOA-related surveillance and monitoring activities has also had detrimental implications for the agency’s ability to provide assurance of the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear program,” the IAEA report said.\\n\\nNuclear fuel enrichment\\n\\nFollowing the prisoner swap in September, Iran tentatively agreed to halt the stockpiling of some enriched uranium, Vaez said.\\n\\n“As part of the de-escalatory understanding between Iran and the U.S., Iran stopped accumulating additional 60% enriched uranium. Well, that might now change, given the rising tensions between the two sides,” he said.\\n\\nFurther enrichment of uranium from 60 to 90 percent purity could take place in a matter of days.\\n\\n“It would take Iran less than a week to enrich enough uranium for a single nuclear weapon. That is down from more than 12 months when President Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. And that\\'s why this is literally a ticking bomb and there needs to be a solution one way or another to curb Iran\\'s nuclear activities,” Vaez told VOA.\\n\\n‘No correlation’\\n\\nIAEA chief Rafael Grossi recently told CNBC that he saw “no correlation” between the Israel-Hamas war and Iran’s nuclear program.\\n\\n“I don’t see a correlation between these two things,” Grossi said in an October 20 interview. “If you look at the bigger picture in terms of security and the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, we have seen moments of increased tension, and this has not resulted in a direct change or shift when it comes to what happens in Iran.”\\n\\nJenkins, the former British ambassador to the IAEA, said there were no signs yet that Iran is seeking a nuclear bomb. “There is still no evidence from the IAEA, whose inspectors continue to visit Iranian plants at very frequent intervals, or from the American intelligence community, which tends to make public its assessments — there\\'s still no evidence that Iran is contemplating a move away from compliance with its essential Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty commitment, which is to refrain from manufacturing nuclear weapons,” he said.\\n\\nLeverage\\n\\nTehran could seek to use its nuclear program as leverage against the West, as tensions increase in the region.\\n\\n“I can imagine them looking for ways of increasing concern and anxiety in the West about their nuclear program, but stopping short of actually, shall we say, crossing the line and ceasing to be in compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. That is, after all, the game they\\'ve been playing for the last five years. Bit by bit, they\\'ve been increasing the level at which they are enriching uranium,” Jenkins told VOA.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Israel has repeatedly said it will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.\\n\\nIsrael itself is widely believed to have atomic weapons, although it does not allow IAEA inspections of its nuclear sites and is not a signatory to the accord.',\n",

That’s as far as I’m going to go,” US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters, declining to say how it was delivered.\\n\\nIsrael has repeatedly accused Iran of being a key force behind the coordinated Hamas attack on Israel, in which terrorists streamed across the border to carry out a devastating assault on nearby communities, killing some 1,400 people, and taking over 220 people hostage. The vast majority of those killed as gunmen seized border communities were civilians — including babies, children and the elderly. Entire families were executed in their homes, and over 260 were slaughtered at an outdoor festival, many amid horrific acts of brutality by the terrorists.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHowever, the Biden administration has not publicly accused Iran of having a direct role in the devastating Oct. 7 attack and has said it appears so far that Tehran was not aware of it beforehand.\\n\\nThe US has noted that Iran has long supported Hamas and has raised concerns that Iran and its proxies could turn the conflict into a wider war.\\n\\nUS officials have routinely stressed that the American response is designed to be proportional, and is aimed at deterring strikes against US personnel who are focused on the fight against the Islamic State group.\\n\\nWhile US officials have not publicly tied the recent string of attacks in Syria and Iraq to the Israel-Hamas war, Iranian officials have openly criticized the US for providing weapons to Israel that have been used to strike Gaza.\\n\\nThe Pentagon, meanwhile, has also beefed up air defenses in the region to protect US forces. Israel has reportedly agreed to delay its Gaza ground operation until the systems are in place.\\n\\nThe US has said it is sending several batteries of Patriot missile systems, a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery and additional fighter jets.\\n\\nThe THAAD is being sent from Fort Bliss, Texas, and the Patriot batteries are from Fort Liberty in North Carolina and Fort Sill in Oklahoma. An Avenger air defense system from Fort Liberty is also being sent.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOfficials have said as many as two battalions of Patriots are being deployed. A battalion can include at least three Patriot batteries, which each have six to eight launchers.\\n\\nUS troops have also deployed or are in the process of going to the Middle East region, including those associated with the air defense systems.\\n\\nThe United States has already deployed two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean in a powerful show of support for Israel.\",\n",

Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said sporadic, limited deliveries were just “crumbs” when measured against the humanitarian needs of 2.4 million people.\\n\\n“The current system in place is geared to fail,” he told a press conference in Jerusalem. “What is needed is meaningful and uninterrupted aid flow. And to succeed, we need a humanitarian ceasefire to ensure this aid reaches those in need.”\\n\\nLazzarini said 57 of the agency’s staff had been killed in the conflict.

More than 250 British lawyers, including professors of law, urged the UK government to press for a ceasefire, saying serious breaches of international law were being committed.\\n\\nFears of the crisis spreading across the region deepened on Friday after US warplanes bombed two locations in eastern Syria linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards.

Almost half of Israelis – 49% – wish to hold off, according to a poll by the newspaper Ma’ariv. It found that 29% of Israelis backed an immediate invasion, with 22% undecided. In a poll on 10 October – three days after the conflict began when Hamas militants entered southern Israel and killed more than 1,400 people – 65% backed a major ground offensive.\\n\\nIsrael’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said on Thursday night a full ground incursion would be launched soon. “We are responding with fire and creating the conditions for the ongoing war. There will also be other stages,” he told Kan radio. “We are preparing them, and we will carry them out. I am determined to deliver victory.”\",\n",

When content from a terrorist organization is identified, it is “hashed” to create a unique identifier that can then be shared among all companies to automatically prevent that video or image from being reshared elsewhere.\\n\\nThe sharing of these hashes and communication around incidents like the Israel-Hamas war are coordinated by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), a small team of experts whose mission is to stop tech platforms from being exploited by violent extremists. The group was founded in 2017 by Facebook, Microsoft, X (then Twitter), and YouTube as a way of centralizing and coordinating the sharing of information. Companies like Dropbox, Amazon, Pinterest, and Zoom also provide funding to the group.\\n\\nGIFCT did not provide a spokesperson to answer WIRED’s questions, but a statement on the group’s website says it is “providing regular situational awareness across member companies and support in addressing content relating to this conflict that violates their platform policies.”\\n\\nEven when mainstream platforms have access to a shared database of verified terrorist content and centralized communications with experts who are tracking this content closely, they still have a lot of work to do in order to prevent violent videos from spreading on their platforms.\\n\\n“This will be a big litmus test for the mainstream platforms,” Hadley says. “We would expect their algorithmic systems to be able to detect the [Hamas] logo, for instance, and respond accordingly.

But he said, “We must stand with our important ally in the Middle East and that’s Israel.”\\n\\nThe new Republican leader who swept into office nearly a month after the ouster of Rep. Kevin McCarthy as speaker had a busy first full day in office, having inherited many of the same political problems that tormented past GOP leaders and challenged their tenure as speaker.\\n\\nIn the morning, Johnson said “prayer is appropriate” as a response to the mass shootings in Maine.\\n\\nJohnson, an evangelical Christian from Louisiana, declined to take questions, including about the possibility of any gun violence legislation from Congress.\\n\\n“Prayer is appropriate at a time like this, that the evil can end and the senseless violence can stop,” he said.\\n\\nThe House convened with a bustle of activity, making up for lost time during the weeks of chaos since McCarthy’s ouster as speaker. But the initial goodwill toward Johnson blurs the political fault lines challenging his ability to lead the GOP majority in the face of daunting issues ahead.\\n\\nBy Nov. 17, the Congress must fund the government again or risk a federal shutdown. Biden wants nearly $106 billion in military and humanitarian aid for Israel and Ukraine. And Republicans are eager to resume their impeachment inquiry into Biden over his son Hunter’s business dealings.\\n\\n“Enough of the chaos, enough of the dysfunction,” said Jeffries, D-N.Y., adding it was time for Congress to get back to business.\\n\\nJeffries said Democrats were “heartbroken” over the latest shootings and stand with the people of Maine in every way possible, including discussing how Congress can address gun violence.\\n\\nJohnson said he and Biden met together for more than 15 minutes before the other party arrived.\\n\\n“It was a productive meeting,” Johnson told reporters back at the Capitol. “I enjoyed my visit with the president.”\\n\\nBiden met with Johnson and Jeffries before the House leaders joined a classified briefing with other congressional lawmakers on the assistance package, according to a White House official.\\n\\nThe briefing in the Situation Room for Johnson and other House leaders on the emergency funding request was the first time the new speaker, who opposes the aid to Ukraine, was getting a close airing from White House officials about Biden’s case for the money. The White House has conducted similar briefings in recent weeks.\\n\\nBiden had called Johnson to congratulate him after his election Wednesday and said it was “time for all of us to act responsibly” to fund the government and provide that foreign aid. “We need to move swiftly,” the president said in a statement.\\n\\nJohnson, 51, swept through on the first ballot with support from all Republicans anxious to put weeks of tumult behind and get on with the business of governing. He was quickly sworn as speaker and is now second in line to the presidency, after the vice president.\\n\\nWhile not the Republicans’ top choice, Johnson had few foes and an important backer in Donald Trump.\\n\\nAt the Capitol on Thursday, Johnson sat down with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who told reporters afterward that he had a “very good” meeting with the new speaker.\\n\\nJohnson met later with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who said on social media they had a “great meeting.” He has also heard from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who told the new speaker in a Wednesday call that a bipartisan agreement with Democrats is the only way to avoid a shutdown.\\n\\nIn winning the gavel, Johnson, who has been in the House for less than a decade, drew together fellow Republicans through his faith, conservative roots and Trump’s nod after more seasoned leaders had failed.\\n\\n“I’m a Bible-believing Christian,” Johnson told Fox’s Sean Hannity.\\n\\nThe speaker said when he’s asked his views on the issues, he advises: “Well, go pick up a Bible off your shelf and read it, that’s my worldview. That’s what I believe.”\\n\\nDemocrats said Johnson, a lawyer specializing in constitutional issues, was an extreme conservative, a strict opponent of abortion access and an architect of Trump’s legal effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election he lost to Democrat Biden.\\n\\nAfter Johnson’s election, lawmakers approved a resolution Wednesday saying the House “stands with Israel” and “condemns Hamas’ brutal war.” They next turned to a stalled government funding bill.\\n\\nRather than take a scheduled work period at home, Republicans rearranged the House calendar to return to Washington next week and keep pushing through the various government funding bills before the Nov. 17 deadline.\\n\\nIn a letter to colleagues, Johnson outlined priorities that include providing a short-term funding bill, into next year, to prevent a November shutdown — almost the same move that led to McCarthy’s ouster.\\n\\n“Speaker Johnson has been very clear that we’ve got to secure America’s border, we want to support Israel,” said Majority Leader Steve Scalize, who conferred with Johnson ahead of the White House meeting. “But all of the other items that the President is talking about run secondary.”\\n\\nRepublican Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Johnson is thoughtful and smart, and understands that aid for Ukraine is a national security issue, despite opposition from other Republicans in their majority.\\n\\n“And what I saw in the Situation Room was I thought he was very open to the idea,” said McCaul.\\n\\nTo avoid a shutdown, Johnson will need to balance far-right demands with the realities of keeping the government functioning. Most Republicans voted against the budget deal McCarthy, R-Calif., struck with Biden earlier this year, demanding steeper spending cuts.\\n\\nSimilar Republican infighting has chased three other GOP speakers to early departures. The difference now is that Republican rules allow any single lawmaker to force a vote to remove the speaker from office.',\n",

Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing.\"\\n\\nHamas terrorists killed at least 1,400 Israelis and wounded more than 4,500 in a massive offensive launched from Gaza on October 7, which included the firing of thousands of rockets at Israel and the infiltration of the Jewish state by terrorist forces.\\n\\n\"Mr. Secretary-General, in what world do you live?\" Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen rebutted as he addressed the Security Council. \"Definitely, this is not our world.\"\\n\\nCohen cancelled a private meeting with Guterres, he subsequently announced on X. \"I will not meet the UN secretary-general. After October 7, there is no place for a balanced approach.

       " {'articleBody': 'There are simply too many instances of these conflicts being traced back to the British Empire to imagine a coincidence\\n\\nFollow us on our Malay and English WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, Tiktok and Youtube channels.\\n\\nBy Saurav Sarkar\\n\\nIsraeli flags were flying over all government buildings in the UK recently, but this isn’t the first time the former imperial hegemon has put its weight behind Zionism.\\n\\nIn 1917 the British government issued the infamous Balfour Declaration.\\n\\nThis brief document – 67 words – was a turning point in modern Palestinian history. It committed Great Britain to establishing a “national home” for Jewish people in Palestine. (The initial language promised a “Jewish state”, but was changed later.)\\n\\nThe Balfour Declaration contained language that was meant to safeguard Palestinians, but we have seen how that has played out in the ensuing century.\\n\\nFrom World War One to 1948, the British ruled Palestine, the bulk of that time under a mandate issued by the League of Nations.\\n\\nThe population of Jewish settlers in Palestine increased over these decades -particularly the 1930s – as the British government fostered their immigration. In 1922 only 11% of the population in the region was Jewish. By 1931 the figure was up to about 17%. By 1939 it was almost 30%.\\n\\nAt that point, the British government sought to limit any further expansion of the Jewish population in order to ensure stability in the region. But by then, it was too late – the facts on the ground had changed. What had been a region that was almost 90% Palestinian had become a contested land between two demographically numerous groups.\\n\\nMoreover, the British had confiscated land from Palestinians to hand it over to Jewish people and engaged in violent repression of incipient Palestinian nationalism.\\n\\nAnd in the 1930s, a British government commission recommended that Palestine be partitioned, laying the groundwork for the failed “two-state solution“.\\n\\nIn other words, this conflict is the product of specific imperial policies that were practised in the first half of the 20th Century to foster a colonial project. The “Jewish question” – Europe’s longstanding inability to adequately address its own anti-Semitism – was made into Palestinians’ Zionist problem by the British Empire.\\n\\nOne of the key features of British rule was to play different groups against each other. One of the key methods adopted by them over the course of centuries and a global collection of provinces was to study the social history of their subjects to manage the politics and play different groups against each other.\\n\\nThe support for Jewish migration to Palestine triggered resentment and mobilisation by indigenous Palestinians, eventually leading to the Great Revolt of 1936-1939.\\n\\nThe revolt, which included a general strike and peasant uprising, was violently repressed by the British government in collaboration with Zionist paramilitaries.\\n\\nHowever, after the revolt, the British began to limit further Jewish immigration to the region, turning against the group they had supported in order to protect their imperial interests. This led to violent attacks by Zionists in Palestine.\\n\\nPalestine is not alone in this fate. In region after region, the British used strategies of ‘divide and rule’ to pit one people against another for the benefit of the empire.\\n\\nIn British India, they pushed the Hindu-Muslim divide, sometimes favouring one population, sometimes the other.\\n\\nIn Cyprus, they pitted the Greeks against the Turks.\\n\\nIn Sri Lanka, it was the Tamils against the Sinhalese.\\n\\nIn Ireland, it was the Catholics against the Protestants. The list goes on.\\n\\nIn all of these places, the supposedly ‘ancient’ politics of inter-group conflict have persisted beyond when the sun set on the British Empire. There have been territorial divides based on ethnicity and/or religion.\\n\\nBritish India became India and Pakistan. Pakistan was then further subdivided into Pakistan and Bangladesh.\\n\\nIreland was split up into the Republic of Ireland and the UK’s Northern Ireland.\\n\\nCyprus is divided in two, and its legal status is still unresolved.\\n\\nIn Sinhalese-dominated Sri Lanka, a 30-year civil war, waged to establish a Tamil state, ended in 2009 in a similar fashion to what we are witnessing in Gaza today.\\n\\nAnd in 1948, Palestine was formally partitioned, establishing a Zionist state and what was meant to be a Palestinian one, with the blessing of the former British rulers who oversaw the beginning of the Nakba.\\n\\nEach of these places has been marked with violent conflict based on ‘ancient’ hatreds that can be traced to the last one or two centuries. It is this commonality that firmly establishes that the British Empire policies are the root cause of the violence in these regions; there are simply too many instances of these conflicts being traced back to the empire to imagine a coincidence.\\n\\nWhile the proximate causes of Israeli apartheid, occupation and genocide clearly lie squarely at the feet of Israel and its chief sponsor, the US, the UK has a special responsibility to make right its historical sins in Palestine – and everywhere else.\\n\\nA minimal first step would be to work to stop the current genocide instead of waving an Israeli flag. But this – let alone reparations – does not seem to be on the table.\\n\\nThis article was produced by Globetrotter.

       " {'articleBody': 'In an era dominated by rapid technological advancements and global interconnectedness, the nature of warfare has evolved. While traditional military conflicts still exist, a new form of warfare has emerged in recent years: disinformation warfare. This subtle, information-based form of aggression leverages the power of the internet and social media to manipulate, deceive, and sow discord.\\n\\nOn Saturday, October 6th, incidentally, of great significance for Jews across the globe, Hamas carried out terror attacks on Israeli kibbutzim and settlements. These attacks involved a surprise infiltration by more than 1200 Hamas terrorists into Israeli territory, targeting towns, settlements, and kibbutzim near the Gaza Strip. The attacks included various methods such as storming Israeli beaches, engaging in firefights with Israeli forces, infiltrating towns, and settlements, opening fire on homes, and taking hostages. The attacks resulted in the killing and injuring of Israeli citizens, including children, women, and the elderly.\\n\\nThe attacks caused significant devastation and loss of life in the affected areas and garnered a military retaliation by the Israeli Army. Incidentally, Oct 6 to October 25 is also the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War of 1973. Yom Kippur is considered the holiest day in the Jewish calendar as it marks the observance of what is translated into the Day of Atonement.\\n\\nWhat has been remarkable amidst this shock, grief, outrage and mourning of the Israeli people, its citizens, its journalists and the IDF is their closing of ranks to counter the disinformation emanating from the mouthpieces of Hamas from Gaza and various media outlets across the Middle East and the West.\\n\\nThe IDF held a Twitter Spaces event on the 10th day, for more than three hours attended by more than 100,000 listeners, clarifying the allegations of targeting refugees leaving Gaza towards the Southern border with Egypt into the Rafah crossing. The IDF spokesperson dispelled fallacies, disinformation, incorrect data and outright lies generated in the wake of the Hamas attacks and the inevitable Israeli military preparations for entering the Gaza Strip.\\n\\nMany Indians find themselves pondering why they aren’t leading in the realm of disinformation warfare, given the ongoing need to counter Pakistani propaganda and address the continuous challenges posed by self-serving politicians who question the motives of the Indian Army. This is particularly pertinent in the context of the recurrent scrutiny from left-leaning political factions.\\n\\nDisinformation warfare often referred to as “information warfare” or “hybrid warfare,” involves the dissemination of false or misleading information with the intent to manipulate public opinion, undermine trust in institutions, and disrupt the social fabric of targeted nations. This tactic is executed through various channels, including state-sponsored troll farms, fake news outlets, and social media platforms. While disinformation campaigns have been employed for decades, the digital age has enabled their proliferation and effectiveness on an unprecedented scale, especially after Elon Musk, the owner of X formerly Twitter opened the app for citizen journalism.\\n\\nThe implications and objectives of disinformation campaigns are to destabilize target nations by exploiting divisions, exacerbating political, ethnic, or social tensions, and fostering public mistrust. This phenomenon is something Indian citizens are aware of by now, employed by not just the Pakistani-ISI but also media houses in the West and the Middle East who employ our version of ‘brown coolies’ or Indian-origin analysts, experts, and academicians to sow discord and to weaken the nation’s narrative in order to gain fame, lucrative careers, incentives. This has been happening since our Independence struggle days – the ‘orientalist’ Western media tropes of the land of snake-charmers and rope tricks’ never having really gone from the ‘white colonial mind’.\\n\\nSeeing the rise of India’s economic future, its geopolitical independence, its stabilising hold of its historical narrative and the rising awareness amongst the masses, the disinformation warfare has also reached peak levels, aiming to erode trust in our democratic institutions, tame our media, and even mock our scientific achievements as was evident during the recent Chandrayaan moon landing and our successful fight against Covid-19 pandemic. A population divided by conflicting narratives is less likely to make informed decisions or unite in times of crisis. Disinformation campaigns can lead to economic harm, particularly when targeting our local industries or native companies while falsely implicating them in wrongdoings. Stock prices can plummet, investments may dwindle, and businesses can suffer reputational damage.\\n\\nThere are lessons to learn from the Israelis today. Even though they are preparing for their war of all wars, to bring peace and stability to the conflict-ridden region and ensure Hamas the terrorist organisation is obliterated forever so that Israeli citizens aren’t targeted ever again; they are also successfully countering the propaganda emanating from Pallywood (a colloquial term for the false and fake videos of brutalities and children’s death originating from Palestinian Territories), often accidentally leaked.\\n\\nAdditionally, the global outrage against Israel, mostly engineered by leftists and woke groups is being countered daily by the social media app X, ensuring that community notes accompany questionable posts with false or misleading information. Citizen journalists are engaging with Hamas supporting rallies in various Western cities, videotaping their anti-Semitic rants, and making sure their employers or educational institutions know about their existence, which has resulted in backlashes and got many rusticated or terminated.\\n\\nIndia is decades behind such a counter strategy but catching up fast. The cultural resurgence of India, generally labelled Hindutva, often disparagingly, is making sure that this time the nation has a hold on its narrative, its strategies, its plans, and foreign policies. But it has a long way to go as compared to the Israelis and Jewish supporting groups. The notorious allegations of an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) politician Raghav Chadha regarding the funeral arrangements of a soldier, forced the ADGPI (Additional Directorate General of Public Information), a department within the Indian Army to issue an official clarification on how the soldier died and that it doesn’t distinguish between soldiers’ deaths, which the politician had questioned.\\n\\nIf the country’s resources and valuable time are used in clearing its position for malicious actors belonging to the country, when will we counter the huge network of anti-India forces, charted out in Rajiv Malhotra and Vidya Vishwanathan’s book ‘Snakes in the Ganga: Breaking India 2.0’? They are embedded in our domestic institutions as well as internationally, collaborating with those, particularly in Turkey and China.\\n\\nWe have a nation to build — our infrastructure is getting an upgrading and a revamping; our educational institutions need overhauling, and our research and development are still not vibrantly active. We have just started defining our geopolitical independence and our insistence on home-manufactured defence systems. We still have to mend our permanent religious fault lines — a baggage of the Partition and Independence struggle days. There are scores of problems that need our attention – socially, politically, economically; that we cannot afford to lag in countering disinformation in peaceful times.\\n\\nThe Israelis, at war, are leading by example and their coordination teams, their collaboration, their precision plans, and their work ethics are something we, a parallel civilisation since ancient times, need to learn from and adopt. Addressing disinformation warfare is a multifaceted challenge that demands collaborative efforts from various stakeholders in India. Firstly, there is a critical need for public education, emphasizing media literacy to enable individuals to critically evaluate the information they encounter, fostering the ability to fact-check and discern reliable sources from unreliable ones. Indians have been forcing tech companies, particularly social media platforms like X, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube to play a pivotal role and proactively engage in combating disinformation by enforcing stringent content moderation, enhancing advertising transparency, and removing fake accounts and bots. Additionally, the Indian government has established policies and regulations to hold disinformation perpetrators accountable, such as withholding accounts of known perps and their accounts and channels in India.\\n\\nA delicate balance has to be struck between preserving free speech and discouraging malicious disinformation. Given the transnational nature of disinformation, forcing international cooperation by India is indispensable in setting norms and agreements for effectively countering this challenge. It is imperative that we Indians recognize the power of disinformation campaigns, work together to counter them, and safeguard our information ecosystem.\\n\\nAs the battlefields shift from the traditional to the digital realm, the weapons used are no longer guns and tanks but false narratives and manipulated data. Confronting this new form of warfare is essential for preserving the integrity of our democratic institutions and the well-being of our society as a whole.\\n\\nALSO READ: Woke Democrat Jews are threat to idea of Israel\\n\\nLike 224 Dislike 28\\n\\n94629\\n\\n1\\n\\n0\\n\\ncookie-check\\n\\nIndia’s turn to learn from Israel how to combat disinformation warfare\\n\\nyes',\n",

Instead, they meet n person in these tunnels to plan the attack.\\n\\nHamas operatives used the tunnel phones to communicate about the operation but stayed dark until it was time to activate and call on hundreds of fighters to launch the attack, which reportedly resulted in the deaths of more than 1,400 Israelis, said the report. During the rampage that day, Hamas operatives also took over 200 hostages – from infants to octogenarians.\\n\\nNew Delhi: A small cell of Hamas planned the 7 October surprise attack on southern Israel for over two years and used a network of hardwired phones built within Gaza’s underground tunnels to communicate with each other, a report has said. These phones could not be tracked by Israeli or US intelligence, the CNN report said, citing intelligence shared by Israel with the United States.\\n\\nColloquially called the “Gaza metro” by Israel Defence Forces (IDF), this network of tunnels forms a vast web where Hamas operatives are known to store rockets and ammunition caches. They also use these tunnels to move about unnoticed, the IDF said, adding that the tunnels contain Hamas’s crucial command and control centres.\\n\\n“The small cell waited until just before the attack was launched to prep a larger group of fighters above ground to carry out the specific operation,” CNN quoted sources briefed on the assault. “One of the sources said that though ground unit commanders and fighters were being trained for many months and kept at a state of general preparedness, they were only informed of the specific plans in the days leading up to the operation,” the report added.\\n\\nThe above-ground training was observed but did not ring major alarm bells, as Israelis thought it was routine.\\n\\nCNN quoted another source saying that Iran “helped Hamas develop their operational security tactics over the years”.\\n\\nHowever, US intelligence does not believe Iran played a direct role in the planning of the 7 October attack, at least for now.\\n\\nThe report revealed that Israel had been aware since the summer that Palestinian militants were using hardwired communication systems in the run-up to the October attack.\\n\\nThe Israeli military found a similar kind of communication system when it raided the city of Jenin in the northern West Bank in the summer, which was dubbed “Operation Home and Garden”. They discovered secure, hardwired communication lines and closed-circuit surveillance cameras that could give advance warning of Israeli troop movements.\\n\\nAt the time, the IDF said it hit a joint operational command centre used by militant cells in Jenin, and noted that it was used for “advanced observation and reconnaissance”. The IDF called it a “hub for coordination and communication among the terrorists”.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Israeli forces continued with their relentless assault on the besieged Gaza enclave in retaliation for the 7 October attack.

Erdan faced a challenging task in persuading General Assembly members not to support a Jordanian resolution demanding an immediate Gaza ceasefire, which did not mention Hamas.\\n\\nThe resolution, which will come to a vote on Friday, is expected to pass given majority support for the Palestinians among member states. However, UNGA resolutions are non-binding and largely symbolic.\\n\\nAccording to Times Of Israel, the text calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all civilian hostages, the protection of civilians and international institutions, and ensuring the safe passage of humanitarian aid into the Strip.\\n\\nThe draft resolution also calls on Israel to rescind its order for Palestinians in northern Gaza to evacuate to the south. Israel says the directive is to protect civilians as it apparently plans to launch a ground incursion that will focus on the northern part of the enclave. Palestinians note that some of those who have evacuated to the south have still been killed in Israeli airstrikes, and the UN resolution casts the measure as an attempt at 'forced transfer of the Palestinian civilian population'.\\n\\nIsrael’s war with Hamas in Gaza erupted after thousands of terrorists burst through the border and rampaged through more than 20 communities. The terrorists killed some 1,400 people, the vast majority of them civilians, massacring them at their homes and at a music festival. They also abducted over 220 people to the Strip as hostages.\\n\\nAt the outset of the emergency session on Gaza called by Jordan and Mauritania, Israel’s mission to the UN, in its effort to bolster opposition to the draft resolution, handed out sheets with a QR code that opens a video showing Hamas atrocities.\\n\\nMoreover, the images included piles of burned bodies, a baby shot in its bed, civilians lying dead in cars and in the street, and a gagged woman who had been burned to death.\\n\\n“I have seen much footage over the past weeks that will be seared into my mind forever, but there is one sight that I keep on seeing when I try to sleep. In the video, one can see a terribly injured civilian – bloodied, yet alive – laying on the ground as a Hamas savage screaming Allahu Akbar repeatedly pummels the man’s neck with a garden hoe in order to decapitate him,” the UN envoy said.\\n\\n“The man on the ground is an agricultural worker from Thailand. He is not Israeli. He is not Jewish. He was merely alive, trying to make a living for his family. But he was decapitated with a blunt gardening tool. Horrifying! Israel is not at war with human beings, we are at war with monsters,” he added.\\n\\nDescribing the horrific massacre, Erdan said the purpose of the terrorists was to “savagely murder every living thing they encountered. Hamas Nazi murderers went from house to house with hit lists.”\\n\\nThe Israeli envoy insisted that “This is not a war with the Palestinians. Israel is at war with the genocidal Hamas terrorist organization… Modern-day Nazis.”\\n\\n“Hamas does not care about the Palestinian people. Hamas has only one goal: to annihilate Israel,” Erdan said.\\n\\n“The drafters of the resolution claim to be concerned about ‘peace,’ yet the depraved murderers who initiated this war are not even mentioned in the resolution,” he said.\\n\\n“They see each one of you as a puppet. They write a resolution completely devoid of any content related to the situation. They assume that you have already forgotten who it is that is responsible for the inhuman violence, and they just expect you to support it. This resolution is a disgrace to your intelligence. It is unfathomable that such a resolution – one that doesn’t even mention Hamas – could possibly be voted upon,” he stated.\",\n",

They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing,” Guterres said.\\n\\nFollowing such remarks, the foreign minister of Israel also canceled his scheduled meeting with the UN chief.\\n\\nAlso, in a post on X, Guterres said: \"The grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the horrific attacks by Hamas.

Why is he backing Hamas? And what’s Turkey’s role in the conflict?\\n\\nLet’s take a closer look:\\n\\nWhat did Erdogan say?\\n\\nAs per The Times of Israel, Erdogan said that Israel and the West ‘can view Hamas as a terrorist organization’.\\n\\n“The West owes you a lot. But Turkey does not owe you anything,” Erdogan, addressing his AK party in Parliament said.\\n\\n“Hamas is not a terrorist organization, it is a group of mujahideen defending their lands.”\\n\\n“Western tears shed for Israel are a manifestation of fraud,” he added, as per Hindustan Times.\\n\\nErdogan further said his plan to visit Israel is off.\\n\\n“We had a project to go to Israel, but it was cancelled, we will not go,” Erdogan added.\\n\\n“I invite all other countries with reason and conscience to put pressure on the … government to return the state of Israel to sanity,” he added as per Politico.\\n\\nErdogan met Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a United Nations summit in New York last month, marking an improvement in relations that began with a decision last year to reappoint ambassadors.\\n\\nThe Turkish leader did not say when he had intended to visit Israel, where Ankara had been eyeing joining a natural gas pipeline project promoted by the United States.\\n\\n“Of course, we had good intentions, but (Netanyahu) abused them,” Erdogan said.\\n\\n“If he had continued with good intentions, our relations might have been different, but now, unfortunately, this will not happen either.”\\n\\nErdogan had initially struck a measured tone on the first day of war, condemning all attacks against civilians and urging Israel to be measured in its response.\\n\\nBut he became much more vocal after the deadly strike on Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza last week, leading to large and angry protests across the Muslim world.\\n\\n“It is clear that security cannot be ensured by bombing hospitals, schools, mosques and churches,” Erdogan said last week in a statement. “I reiterate our call on the Israeli government not to expand the scope of its attacks against civilians and to immediately stop its operations that are bordering genocide.”\\n\\nThe Times of Israel noted that Erdogan is yet to condemn Hamas’ killings of Israel’s citizens.\\n\\nThis isn’t the first time Erdogan has struck such a tone about Hamas.\\n\\nErdogan previously posted on X in 2018, “Hamas is not a terrorist organization and Palestinians are not terrorists.”\\n\\nIt is a resistance movement that defends the Palestinian homeland against an occupying power.”\\n\\nWhy is Erdogan backing Hamas?\\n\\nFor that, it is important to understand why Erdogan is hostile to Israel.\\n\\nAnkara’s relations with Israel have been strained since 2010 when an Israeli raid on a Turkish ship carrying aid into Gaza left 10 civilians dead.\\n\\nAs per The Times of Israel, prior to that the two nations were long-time allies.\\n\\nSince the incident, Netanyahu and Erdogan have repeatedly traded insults.\\n\\nErdogan in 2014 accused Israel of ‘keeping Hitler’s spirit alive’ amid a war with Gaza.\\n\\nTies rebounded slightly, only for both nations to recall their ambassadors after violence broke out in Gaza and the Trump regime shifted its embassy to Jerusalem.\\n\\nErdogan in December 2020, facing economic headwinds domestically and diplomatic isolation globally, began signalling about being open to improving ties.\\n\\nIn August, Israel and Turkey announced that diplomatic ties were completely restored, as per The Times of Israel.\\n\\nWhile there was some thawing of the relations lately, the Hamas attack and its aftermath have changed the equation yet again.\\n\\nIsrael’s foreign ministry spokesperson posted on X:\\n\\nIsrael wholeheartedly rejects the Turkish President’s harsh words about the terrorist organization Hamas.\\n\\nHamas is a despicable terrorist organization worse than ISIS that brutally and intentionally murders babies, children, women and the elderly, takes civilians hostage and uses… pic.twitter.com/LU4mJGz18v — Lior Haiat 🇮🇱 (@LiorHaiat) October 25, 2023\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is Turkey’s role in conflict?\\n\\nTurkey in the past has pulled for a two-state solution as the way to solve the Israel-Palestine problem.\\n\\nHowever, under Erdogan, it has clearly backed Hamas.\\n\\nAs per The Times of Israel, Turkey helmed by Erdogan has a long and lasting relationship with Hamas.\\n\\nNot only has Erdogan kept in touch with Hamas leadership since the war kicked off, he has even allowed the terror group to keep an office in Istanbul for more than a decade.\\n\\nSome have argued that Turkey is uniquely positioned to play peacemaker.\\n\\n“Turkey has a good communication channel with Hamas, which is an important asset,” Taha Ozhan, research director at the Ankara Institute, told Al Jazeera. “It has been built up over 17 years, when Turkey was the only country to invite Hamas into [its capital].\\n\\nOzhan, a former chair of the Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs committee, added, “In these times of crisis, the communication channels and relations are important.”\\n\\nTurkey’s foreign minister Hakan Fidan has said Ankara is prioritising aid to Gaza and securing the release of hostages taken by Hamas.\\n\\n“We have started discussing … with the political section of Hamas,” Fidan said. “We’ve been putting a lot of effort to make sure that children and foreigners especially are released.”\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Erdogan accused the United Nations Security Council – where the United States, Britain and France have permanent seats – of bowing to the “Israeli regime”.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, he added: “Those outside the region should stop pouring fuel into the fire.\\n\\n“All parties should take their hands off the trigger and a ceasefire should be declared immediately… Direct or indirect negotiations should be initiated to release the hostages.”\\n\\nErdogan is expected to appear at a massive rally in Istanbul on Saturday defending Palestinian right.\\n\\nWhat do experts say?\\n\\nThat Erdogan’s words have seemingly put paid to any notion that Ankara could act impartially.\\n\\nA piece in CFR contended that the Turkish people’s outpouring of sympathy for Gaza is only likely to further cement Erdogan’s bond with Hamas.\\n\\n“Still, Erdogan’s sympathies for Hamas notwithstanding, he is also acutely aware that a major conflagration in the region would be detrimental to everyone, Turkey included. This explains why he reportedly warned his Iranian counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi, against steps that would increase tensions,” the piece argued.\\n\\nThe piece added that Erdogan is now looking at the relationship with Israel and the United States further going downhill.\\n\\n“Erdogan could have initially contributed much to the search for a compromise in this conflict. He has eschewed the little trust Washington may have had in him with the stridency of his anti-American language. He appears to have dealt himself out of the US-led negotiations,” the piece concluded.\\n\\nA piece in Foreign Policy said Erdogan made a personal choice to foster the relationship with Hamas.\\n\\n“At this point, though, the Hamas relationship has deep roots in Turkey and will be difficult to uproot,” the piece said. It added that no one takes Erdogan seriously due to his ties with Hamas.\\n\\n“In charting such a course, Erdogan is once again acting in a manner that confirms the West’s deepest suspicions about his true affinities. As the Biden administration continues to shore up support for Israel through U.S. Secretary of State Antony’s Blinken’s shuttle diplomacy efforts, the only stop missing from his tour of the region is Ankara. Turkey appears to have made its choice to stand with Hamas, only because Erdogan wanted it this way,” the piece concluded.\\n\\nBut others put the ball squarely in the court of Israel and the West.\\n\\n“Without talking about occupation, without talking about Palestine and Palestinians’ situation, there’s no room to move, it’s just talk,” Ozhan told Al Jazeera.\\n\\n“It depends on if Israel – and the support it has coming from Washington and Europe – are really interested in mediation.”\\n\\nOhan warned that a ‘ripple effect’ could widen the conflict.\\n\\n“The wise choice should be re-establishing a political context and using this crisis as a leverage to create a political framework. But it depends on Israel and it depends on some Western capitals.”\\n\\nWith inputs from agencies',\n",

He also wanted to assure that Israel is” not left alone in the war against terrorism”.\\n\\nHamas has released two elderly Israeli women who were among the hundreds of hostages it had abducted during the October 7 attack. Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, and Nurit Cooper, 79, were taken out of Gaza at the Rafah crossing into Egypt, as per footage shown on Egyptian TV. The women were abducted by Hamas along with their husbands. Their husbands, ages 83 and 84, were not released. Lifshitz’ daughter, Sharone Lifschitz, expressed her relief at her release adding she will remain focused on securing the release of her father and others.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Israel said it had launched 400 airstrikes over the past day. With the strikes, it managed to kill Hamas commanders. It also hit militants who were preparing to launch rockets at Israel and struck command centres and a Hamas tunnel shaft. The previous day Israel had reported 320 strikes.\\n\\nAs per Palestinian official news agency WAFA, many of the airstrikes hit residential buildings and the buildings in southern Gaza where Israel had asked civilians to take shelter. A four-storey building was hit in an overnight strike in the southern city of Khan Younis. The hit killed at least 32 people and wounded several others.\\n\\nAs per Israel, the militants have fired over 7,000 rockets at them since the beginning of the war. Hamas said it fired a new barrage on Tuesday morning.\\n\\nThe UN on Monday said that at least 1.4 million Palestinians in Gaza have had to flee their homes and around 580,000 of them are taking shelter in UN-run schools and shelters.\\n\\nThe Israel-Palestine war has so far killed over 5,000 Palestinians. This includes some 2,000 minors and around 1,100 women, as per Hamas-run Health Ministry said. This figure includes the people who died in an explosion at a hospital last week. The fighting has killed more than 1,400 people in Israel — mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack.\\n\\nOn Monday, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the explosion at the hospital was most likely caused by a missile fired from within Gaza and not by a rocket from Israel. The British government judges that the explosion was likely caused by a missile, or part of one, that was launched from within Gaza towards Israel,” Sunak told parliament.\\n\\nA third aid convoy entered Gaza on Monday with a tiny fraction of supplies that the aid groups said were essential.\\n\\n(With Agency inputs)',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'To the editor:\\n\\nIsrael follows the laws of war and international law and is trying to evacuate all the northern parts of the Gaza Strip and mainly the area of Gaza City, because this is the most crucial center of gravity of Hamas. Most of their assets are located there, and Israel doesn’t intend to harm innocent people, and Israel doesn’t want collateral damage. And therefore they are trying to convince the population to leave because the area is saturated with Hamas assets. The latest intelligence has produced evidence that now Hamas may be seeking the use chemical weapons.\\n\\nThe reason that Israel must bomb and demolish so many buildings is because Hamas is everywhere where their basic organizing rationale is to use their people as human shields. They do it in the most cynical and brutal manner, and they wish to have casualties to use the international media and international tribunals in order to demonize Israel and gain empathy and support. It is the ultimate absurdity when these barbarians who do not respect any international law or norms are using these platforms to make their case. Israel has to clear the area and prepare the best conditions for ground forces to enter to accomplish the mission to deal with all underground infrastructure and to finish the job.\\n\\nWe now know that Israel was falsely accused by Hamas of allegedly killing 500 in a hospital in Gaza, that turned out to be a misfire of a Hamas rocket. Again, Hamas wishes to have casualties to use the international media and international tribunals to demonize Israel and gain empathy and support.\\n\\nI reiterate that any support of Hamas, Iran, Hezbollah and any other radical ISIS movements, whether verbal or physical, should be addressed as an act of incitement when encouraging these heinous and barbaric acts. And, that any protest in the United States, whether in a congressional office building (obstructing Congress), streets of America or on college campuses in support of this recent call for global jihad supporting these barbaric acts by Hamas and their partners, should be prosecuted the same manner as the incitement on Jan. 6, 2021 on grounds of endangering public peace and safety. We have seen violence erupt from these recent Palestinian protest marches in New York City and other cities across the U.S. on the police and others.\\n\\nFurthermore, any foreign non-citizen engaged in this support by protesting in the streets of America should be expelled for our nation to their country of origin immediately.\\n\\nJack Wagner\\n\\nCape Coral',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'I had a request to do another aviation story recently. As luck would have it, one popped up on Monday when an off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot decided to try to kill everyone on board his flight. I’m not sure that there was a connection between the request and the incident, but I also can’t be sure that there isn’t. Who knows what awesome powers my readers might be tapped into, but let’s be careful what we ask for.\\n\\nLet’s start at the beginning. Alaska Airlines Flight 2059 is a regular flight from Everett, Washington (KPAE) to San Francisco (KSFO). This flight was operated by Alaska’s regional codeshare partner, Horizon Air, and was flown with an Embraer 175 regional jet, an airplane that resembles a baby 737 but is typically configured for between 76 and 88 passengers.\\n\\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I fly another Embraer product, the Legacy 500, in my corporate aviation job. The two planes are both manufactured by the Brazilian aerospace company and are both sometimes referred to as “jungle jets,” but they are completely different types and I have never been trained on the 175.\\n\\nOn Sunday, an off-duty pilot was commuting in the cockpit of the airliner when the pilot-turned-passenger, in the words of Alaska’s official statement, “unsuccessfully attempted to disrupt the operation of the engines.”\\n\\nThe crew, the statement continues, “quickly responded, engine power was not lost and the crew secured the aircraft without incident.”\\n\\n“Following appropriate FAA procedures and guidance from Air Traffic Control, the flight was safely diverted to Portland International Airport,” Alaska says. “The jump seat occupant [the perpetrator] is currently in custody and the event is being investigated by law enforcement authorities, which includes the FBI and the Port of Portland Police Department.”\\n\\nThe FlightAware track for the flight shows a 50-minute flight with a cruise altitude of 35,000 feet. The flight is just south of Portland, Oregon (KPDX) when suddenly the plane begins a descent at a turn back to the north. Based on this depiction, it appears that the attack took place at about 6:26 p.m. Pacific Time.\\n\\nThe first question that many readers will have is why an off-duty pilot was in the cockpit of an airliner in the first place. The simple answer is that he was on the way to work. He was scheduled to fly a 737 trip out of San Francisco later.\\n\\nMany airline pilots don’t live at their base. Airlines extend free or low-cost travel benefits to their employees provided that the seat is not taken by a paying customer. At the companies I used to work for, this was called “non-revenue space-available” travel. Usually, it was shortened to “non-rev.”\\n\\nPilots have an additional privilege called “jump-seating.” Airline cockpits contain a small foldout seat called a jumpseat where an additional occupant can sit inside the cockpit perched behind and between the two pilots. The jumpseat is intended for check airmen to observe the crew on line checks (observations of a routine airline flight to ensure compliance with standard procedure), but the vast majority of the time, it goes unused. If the cabin seats are full, sometimes pilots commuting to or from their base are allowed to sit in the jump seat. If you’ve seen the movie “Catch Me If You Can,” you’ve seen the general way that jumpseating works.\\n\\nABC News reports that the suspect was en route to San Francisco to work. The flight may have been full in the back so he had to ride on the jumpseat. For some reason, as yet undisclosed, he tried to pull the airplane’s throttles back and cause a crash.\\n\\nReuters adds that the suspect tried to engage the engine fire suppression system. This is a key detail because most fire switches on jet airplanes do several things. The goal of pressing the switch is to stop a fire so it cuts off several items that could add fuel to a burning engine. These include closing shutoff valves for the fuel and hydraulic systems and removing electrical power from the engine. Additionally, engine fire extinguishers are armed, and bleed air valves are closed to prevent fiery hot air from moving to other parts of the plane.\\n\\nThe fire switches are always a guarded switch with a cover that has to be opened before you can press it. Why? Because pressing the switch cuts off a running engine, which is almost always a bad thing in an airborne aircraft. I say “almost” because there are certain times, such as when an engine is on fire, that shutting the engine down is preferable to keeping it running, but these are rare occurrences.\\n\\nThe fact that the suspect flipped up a protective cover to try to press these fire switches and shut off the engines says a lot about his intent. He wanted to crash the airplane and kill everyone on board.\\n\\nI’ll add that if the engines were shut down, they could be restarted, but under the circumstances, it is likely that there would have been a disaster. Restarting the engines is a complex procedure. That’s especially true if both engines are shut down, which would require the crew to maintain control of an airplane that is quickly losing energy. In this scenario, with a suicidal passenger in the cockpit trying to make you lose control, the odds would not have been good for success.\\n\\nThe suspect in custody is Joseph David Emerson, 44. Numerous outlets report that Emerson was (I assume that it’s past tense by now) a pilot with Alaska Airlines. No motive has been named, but there are several obvious possibilities.\\n\\nThe new Hamas war has brought rumors of terrorist strikes in the US and there have been “homegrown” terrorist attacks by self-radicalized American terrorists in the past. There is so far no evidence that Emerson was a radical Muslim, and the FAA said that the incident does not appear connected to world events.\\n\\nFar more likely is that Emerson was homicidal/suicidal for personal reasons. Back in 2015, I wrote an article about pilot suicides for the now-defunct Examiner.com which is still available on my blog. A number of airline pilots have chosen to end their lives by taking their passengers and fellow crewmembers with them. Notable examples of crashes that are known or suspected to be the result of suicidal pilots include Germanwings Flight 9525 in 2015, EgyptAir 990 in 1999, Japan Air Lines 350 in 1982, Malaysia 370 in 2014, and China Eastern Airlines 5735 in 2022.\\n\\nInterestingly, this isn’t the first time that a suicidal employee has targeted Horizon Air. In 2018, a disgruntled mechanic stole a De Havilland Q400 turboprop airliner and performed an impromptu airshow before crashing it into an island in Puget Sound. Only the hijacker was killed in that incident.\\n\\nThere has also been at least one case of a cockpit jumpseater attacking the crew in the flight. Back in 1994, a jumpseater on a FedEx freighter attacked the crew with hammers, a knife, and a spear gun that he had carried on board in a guitar case. The crew fought back and ultimately subdued the suicidal hijacker, a FedEx flight engineer, with the help of aerial maneuvers that made it difficult for him to stay upright.\\n\\nThrough the years, I have also seen rumors that at least some of the September 11 hijackers were in the jumpseat, but I have never seen this confirmed. Nevertheless, the entire industry response to hijackings changed after those attacks. Those changes included strengthened cockpit doors and more stringent security measures for jumpseaters.\\n\\nNew measures also included the Federal Flight Deck Officer and Federal Air Marshal programs. FFDOs were pilots deputized to carry guns to protect their airplanes. The fact that Joseph David Emerson, 44, is still alive to see 45 is evidence that no FFDO or Air Marshal was on board Alaska 2059.\\n\\nAs to why Emerson would try to kill himself and a planeload of passengers, I can only speculate. Previous motives for pilot suicides have included mental illness, job pressures, and family and financial problems. Airline flying can be stressful and the current work environment is one that can include a lot of time away from home and exhausting schedules. Airline jobs are notoriously rough on marriages and can lead to what is sometimes termed as AIDS, “Aviation-Induced Divorce Syndrome.” This, in turn, can lead to financial problems.\\n\\nBack in August, a United Airlines pilot was arrested after assaulting a parking lot gate with an ax at Denver International Airport. CBS News reported that the pilot told sheriff’s deputies that he “just hit his breaking point.”\\n\\nThe Daily Mail reports that Emerson was the married father of two boys who seemed to be the perfect father and husband. Still, personal strife can be difficult to diagnose from next door. The Mail also reports that Emerson lives with his family in Pleasant Hill, California, a San Francisco suburb, so it wasn’t clear why he was flying to San Francisco from Everett, but the answer to that question might provide a motive.\\n\\nThe incident seems to have been handled discretely at the time. It isn’t clear if any passengers or law enforcement officers traveling on the flight helped to subdue and restrain Emerson, but there have been some indications that it may have been a momentary lapse on Emerson’s part rather than a determined attack. Passengers told ABC News that they were told that there was a “disturbance in the cockpit” and that Emerson had suffered a “mental breakdown.”\\n\\n“It was very professional, handled very calmly, and we didn’t really know what was going on until we landed,” passenger Alex Wood said.\\n\\nEmerson now faces 83 counts of attempted murder and a host of other charges. It may be fortunate that he snapped when he did rather than later as a crewmember at the controls.',\n",

The Pentagon has said it will take additional measures if attacks by Iran’s proxies continue. The strikes were ordered by president Joe Biden according to Reuters. The Guardian’s international security correspondent, Jason Bourke, has reported that militia linked to Iran have hit US bases in Syria and Iraq, raising fears of a regional conflagration. The attacks have been claimed by groups either directly controlled by Tehran or sharing the ideology of other groups currently fighting Israel. On Thursday, a US base at Kharab al-Jir in Syria was attacked for the second time in two days, and a base in western Iraq was also hit. Thursday’s attacks came after more than a dozen other small-scale strikes on US bases in the region which have wounded 24 US soldiers and caused the death of one civilian contractor.

Civilians – wherever they are – must be protected equally. Gaza’s civilians did not choose this war. Atrocities should not be followed by more atrocities. The response to war crimes is not more war crimes. The framework of international law is very clear on this and well established. It will take genuine and courageous efforts to go back to the roots of this deadly deadlock and offer political options that are viable and can enable an environment of peace, stability and security. Until then, we must make sure that the rules of international humanitarian law are respected, and civilians spared and protected. An immediate humanitarian ceasefire must be enacted to allow safe, continuous and unrestricted access to fuel, medicine, water and food in the Gaza Strip. Dag Hammarskjöld, the second UN secretary-general, once said: “The UN was not created in order to bring us to heaven, but in order to save us from hell.” The reality today in Gaza is that there is not much humanity left and hell is settling in. The generations to come will know that we watched this human tragedy unfold over social media and news channels. We will not be able to say we did not know. History will ask why the world did not have the courage to act decisively and stop this hell on Earth. I run the UN agency for Palestine refugees.

We are prepared to take further measures to protect our people if necessary,” a second official official said.\\n\\n\\n\\n10h ago 23.21 EDT Here is the full statement by US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin on the targeted strikes in Syria: Today, at President Biden’s direction, US military forces conducted self-defence strikes on two facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and affiliated groups. These precision self-defense strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against US personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on October 17. As a result of these attacks, one US citizen contractor died from a cardiac incident while sheltering in place; 21 US personnel suffered from minor injuries, but all have since returned to duty. The President has no higher priority than the safety of US personnel, and he directed today’s action to make clear that the United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself, its personnel, and its interests. The United States does not seek conflict and has no intention nor desire to engage in further hostilities, but these Iranian-backed attacks against US forces are unacceptable and must stop. Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces. We will not let them. If attacks by Iran’s proxies against US forces continue, we will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to protect our people. These narrowly tailored strikes in self-defence were intended solely to protect and defend US personnel in Iraq and Syria. They are separate and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, and do not constitute a shift in our approach to the Israel-Hamas conflict. We continue to urge all state and non-state entities not to take action that would escalate into a broader regional conflict.\\n\\n\\n\\n10h ago 23.13 EDT The below image shows al-Tanf Garrison in Syria, one of the two locations where drones were used to target US personnel.

The strikes were carried out by pilots in F-16 planes.\\n\\n\\n\\n11h ago 22.48 EDT Reuters reported this week the US military was taking new measures to protect its Middle East forces during the ramp-up in attacks by suspected Iran-backed groups, and was leaving open the possibility of evacuating military families if needed.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe measures include increasing US military patrols, restricting access to base facilities and boosting intelligence collection, including through drone and other surveillance operations, officials say.\\n\\n\\n\\n11h ago 22.45 EDT AP: US officials have not publicly tied the recent string of attacks in Syria and Iraq to the violence in Gaza, but Iranian officials have openly criticised the US for providing weapons to Israel that have been used to strike Gaza, resulting in civilian death. The Pentagon, meanwhile, has beefed up air defences in the region to protect US forces. The US has said it is sending several batteries of Patriot missile systems, a Terminal High Altitude Area Defence battery and additional fighter jets. Ryder said Thursday that about 900 troops have deployed or are in the process of going to the Middle East, including those associated with the air defence systems.\\n\\n\\n\\n11h ago 22.41 EDT In his statement, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said the US does not seek a broader conflict, but if Iranian proxy groups continue, the US won’t hesitate to take additional action to protect its forces. According to the Pentagon, all the US personnel hurt in the militant attacks received minor injuries and all returned to duty. In addition, a contractor suffered a cardiac arrest and died while seeking shelter from a possible drone attack. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin speaks during a press conference at the Nato headquarters in Brussels, on 11 October 2023. Photograph: Simon Wohlfahrt/AFP/Getty Images But officials at the Pentagon and the White House have made it clear for the past week that the US would respond to the attacks, with Ryder saying again Thursday that it would be “at the time and place of our choosing.” “I think we’ve been crystal clear that we maintain the inherent right of defending our troops and we will take all necessary measures to protect our forces and our interests overseas,” he told reporters during a Pentagon briefing earlier in the day.\\n\\nUpdated at 23.15 EDT\\n\\n11h ago 22.39 EDT More now on those strikes on Syria by the US. According to the Pentagon, there have been at least 12 attacks on US bases and personnel in Iraq and four in Syria since 17 October, AP reports. Air Force. Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said 21 U.S. personnel were injured in two of those assaults that used drones to target al-Asad Airbase in Iraq and al-Tanf Garrison in Syria.\\n\\n\\n\\n11h ago 22.22 EDT The US carries out airstrikes on Iranian facilities in eastern Syria The US military carried out strikes against two facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and groups it backs, the Pentagon has said, adding that they came in response to a spate of attacks against US forces in both Iraq and Syria. “These precision self-defence strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against US personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on October 17,” defense secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. The Pentagon has said it will take additional measures if attacks by Iran’s proxies continue. The strikes were ordered by president Joe Biden according to Reuters. The Guardian’s international security correspondent, Jason Bourke, has reported that militia linked to Iran have hit US bases in Syria and Iraq, raising fears of a regional conflagration. The attacks have been claimed by groups either directly controlled by Tehran or sharing the ideology of other groups currently fighting Israel. On Thursday, a US base at Kharab al-Jir in Syria was attacked for the second time in two days, and a base in western Iraq was also hit. Thursday’s attacks came after more than a dozen other small-scale strikes on US bases in the region which have wounded 24 US soldiers and caused the death of one civilian contractor.

An official declaration will be issued after a two-day summit of leaders in Brussels. The agreement was reached late on Thursday after further concessions to Spain, which sought mention of a “ceasefire” – considering this to be a stronger message from the EU. But the demand for a ceasefire from the Spanish president was also a strategic move designed to extract other concessions in the text. Pedro Sánchez persuaded other EU leaders to agree to support a peace conference on a two-state solution – a call that is now in the formal declaration. The member states also agreed specific language on the killing of civilians in Gaza and Israel. “The European Council reiterates the importance of ensuring the protection of all civilians at all times in line with international humanitarian law. It deplores all loss of civilian life,” read the additional paragraph.

Johnson, a staunch conservative allied with Donald Trump, has shown shown little interest in providing additional money from Congress to support Ukraine. Biden met briefly with Johnson and also with Jeffries before the House leaders joined a classified briefing with other congressional lawmakers on the assistance package, according to a White House official. “It was a productive meeting,” Johnson told reporters back at the Capitol. “I enjoyed my visit with the president.” After Johnson’s election, lawmakers approved a resolution Wednesday saying the House “stands with Israel” and “condemns Hamas’ brutal war.” They next turned to a stalled government funding bill. By 17 November, the Congress must fund the government again or risk a federal shutdown. Biden wants nearly $106bn in military and humanitarian aid for Israel and Ukraine.\\n\\n\\n\\n13h ago 21.05 EDT Moving on from that while we await further details, the Associated Press has published satellite images of the damage to buildings in Gaza. In images shot Saturday by Maxar Technologies, four- and five-story buildings in the Izbat Beit Hanoun neighbourhood are in various states of collapse.

The Israel Defense Forces and NSO, which makes Pegasus, declined to comment.\\n\\nThailand, where democracy activists were targeted, is among 45 countries where the research group CitizenLab said Pegasus spyware has been detected.\\n\\nNSO maintains that it sells Pegasus only to governments but it has never been established which Thai state entity acquired the spyware and for what purposes.\\n\\nCandiru, meanwhile, said it a statement that it was ready to assist the Israeli war effort in any way needed.\\n\\nMore than 200 people — mainly Israelis but also several foreigners including 18 Thais — are captive in Gaza.

Amnesty International, Citizen Lab and Forensic Architecture in 2021 documented the use of the spyware in more than 60 cases to target government critics in many countries. In addition to Thailand, they included Rwanda, Togo, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Morocco and India.\\n\\nThe US Commerce Department blacklisted NSO and Candiru that year, banning them from receiving export contracts from American companies.

What roles did the British and other Arab powers play in this historical context? Read this full article.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnti-semitism and Zionism\\n\\nAs per the Hebrew Bible, ‘Israel’ is the name God gave to Jacob, the grandson of Abraham, who is considered the patriarch of all three ‘Abrahamic’ religions — Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The offspring(descendants) of Abraham established their roots in Canaan, an area that approximately corresponds to the present-day territory of Israel.\\n\\nTrending Now\\n\\nFast forward to the late 19th century, and Canaan, previously governed by a series of empires including the Greeks, Romans, Persians, Crusaders, and various Islamic powers, found itself under the rule of the Ottoman Sultanate. During this period, the Jewish community, known as Jews, was dispersed across numerous nations, often thriving as prosperous minorities but susceptible to persecution, particularly in Europe.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDuring the 1880s in Imperial Russia, there were violent pogroms directed at the Jewish population. In France, the Dreyfus affair of 1894, involving the false conviction of a Jewish soldier for allegedly sharing crucial information with Germany, brought to the forefront the widespread anti-Semitic biases of the era. Consequently, within the Jewish community, a sense began to develop that their safety and security would only be assured if they had a nation of their own. This movement, aimed at establishing a Jewish homeland, became recognized as Zionism.\\n\\nIn 1896, Theodor Herzl, an Austro-Hungarian individual, released a pamphlet titled ‘Der Judenstaat,’ outlining his vision for a Jewish nation. This pamphlet gained significant recognition, establishing Herzl as the pioneer of political Zionism. In the initial stages, various regions including Uganda and Argentina were contemplated as potential sites for this homeland. Nevertheless, consensus eventually gravitated toward Palestine, the biblical homeland of the Jews, housing numerous sacred sites from their heritage.\\n\\nBefore World War 1\\n\\nIn due course, Jewish migration, known as Aliyah, to Palestine was set in motion. The initial influx, spanning from 1881 to 1903, is referred to as the First Aliyah. These newcomers started to acquire extensive land holdings and engaged in agriculture. It wasn’t long before the presence of these arrivals began to impact the native Palestinian population, although it would take several years before the conflict would be explicitly characterized in these divisive terms.\\n\\nDuring this era, Palestine was simply a single province within the sprawling and often poorly administered Ottoman Empire. The inhabitants did not inherently consider themselves as ‘Palestinians,’ but rather identified with broader categories such as Ottoman subjects, Arabs, and Muslims, or aligned themselves along clan and familial affiliations. A prevailing practice was absentee landlordism, whereby land was sold to Jews by property owners who were not resident in those areas, as well as by Ottoman officials who were susceptible to bribery. The local residents, who were the actual cultivators of the land, were typically rural, economically disadvantaged, and had limited literacy, and consequently, they had limited influence in these transactions.\\n\\nWith the arrival of these new settlers, it swiftly became apparent that they had no intention of assimilating into the local culture. Unlike the Jewish communities that had longstanding roots in Palestine, these recent arrivals had limited knowledge of Arabic and were primarily associated with their own community. While in the past, Arab laborers were employed to work on their farms, the increasing influx of Jewish immigrants made this practice less common. Furthermore, previously, when the land changed ownership, the tenants typically continued working under the new landlord. However, when the land was purchased by a Jewish owner, Arab tenants were often displaced, losing their homes and communities in the process.\\n\\nThe Jewish population distinguished themselves from the local inhabitants in various ways, often asserting their perceived superior status. They introduced mechanized agriculture and brought in electricity, aligning with their mission to establish an ideal homeland. They did not readily adopt local customs, and their towns and settlements, exemplified by Tel Aviv founded in 1909, reflected European sensibilities, standing in stark contrast to the modest Arab neighborhoods.\\n\\nThe enterprise in Israel received substantial funding from wealthy Jewish benefactors abroad, including notable figures like the Rothschild family. As the Jewish presence in Palestine expanded, local apprehension and resentment toward these newcomers intensified. While Ottoman officials did prohibit the sale of land to foreign Jews, this decree was not effectively enforced. In 1908, following the overthrow of the Ottoman Sultan in the Young Turks revolution, Jewish migration efforts became more organized and systematic. Simultaneously, Jews in other countries worked to garner international support for their cause.\\n\\nThe Balfour Declaration\\n\\nOne pivotal moment that potentially reshaped the landscape of West Asia was the Balfour Declaration of 1917. In this landmark event, a letter from a British official to a wealthy British Jew played a decisive role in determining the future of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.\\n\\nBritish Mandate and World War II\\n\\nFollowing the downfall of the Ottoman Empire in the wake of World War I, its erstwhile domains were divided among the Allies, with the eventual aim of promoting self governance.\\n\\nUN Resolution and Wars\\n\\nIn November 1947, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution to partition Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem placed under UN administration. According to Black’s book, “The proposed Jewish state was allocated 55 percent of the territory, including the sparsely populated Negev desert, and it was expected to be home to around 500,000 Jews and 400,000 Arabs. The Arab state was designated to possess 44 percent of the land and had a minority population of 10,000 Jews.” The Arab areas encompassed the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinian side rejected this resolution, leading to Israel declaring independence on May 14, 1948.\\n\\nThis period was marked by civil war, witIsraeli military groups forcibly displacing many Palestinians. For Palestinians, the establishment of Israel is remembered as the Naqba, or the catastrophe, symbolizing the day they lost their homeland.\\n\\nIsrael faced invasion from Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon after declared independence. Nevertheless, with unwavering support from the US, Israel successfully repelled these major attacks. This was followed by more Arab-Israeli wars, resulting in Israel gaining control over significant territories. It is worth noting that, Today, out of the 193 UN member states, 139 recognize Palestine, while 165 recognize Israel. The Gaza Strip and the West Bank remain under Israeli military control.\\n\\nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

The country\\'s intention comes in the wake of the devastating events on October 7 when Hamas militants launched a brutal attack within Israel, resulting in the tragic loss of over 1,400 lives.\\n\\nLevy emphasised that Israel plans to employ its military force with prudence and careful consideration. Israel will decide the timing of the action in alignment with its strategic interests.\\n\\n“Israel is going to use its force judiciously and carefully at a time of our choosing when we decide that it is right for us to proceed. But it\\'s important to understand that Hamas declared war on Israel on the morning of October 7, with the most shocking and brutal terror attack that anyone can possibly imagine, and Israeli society is united.”\\n\\nHe further added, \"We have no choice but to dismantle both the administrative and military capabilities of the group responsible for this atrocity.

There are currently over 220 hostages within Gaza, ranging from infants to the elderly, some without access to essential medication. We demand their immediate and unconditional release, as well as access to the International Red Cross. This is non-negotiable and a fundamental humanitarian requirement. We expect the international community to continue exerting pressure on Hamas to release these hostages, as this constitutes a war crime.\"\\n\\nThe death toll in the Israel-Hamas war has crossed 6,000 as Israeli airstrikes continue unabated in the Gaza Strip. Israel claimed that it attacked over 300 targets in the Gaza Strip in just the last 24 hours.

       " {'articleBody': 'Tunnel warfare is a battlefield challenge as old as time, yet in the modern era, it continues to confound even the mightiest of military forces. Throughout history, from the Battle of Iwo Jima 70 years ago to the relentless persistence of the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War, underground tunnels have proven to be formidable obstacles.\\n\\nIn the Battle of Iwo Jima, American forces clashed with fierce resistance on the small island in the Pacific during World War II. The Japanese defenders had burrowed an extensive network of tunnels and underground bunkers, which became a nightmarish obstacle for the U.S. troops. The subterranean labyrinth allowed the enemy to hide, ambush, and wage a prolonged defence, defying conventional tactics and lengthening the battle.\\n\\nFast forward to the jungles of Vietnam, where Viet Cong soldiers adopted a similar strategy. They used a vast and intricate tunnel system to resist the might of the United States military during the Vietnam War. These tunnels provided not only shelter but also ingenious pathways for the guerrilla fighters to evade, attack, and disappear, making it one of the most elusive and challenging conflicts in modern warfare.\\n\\nAs Israel stands poised for a possible ground invasion of Gaza, a daunting obstacle looms beneath the surface, threatening to complicate an already complex and treacherous mission. This subterranean challenge is none other than the extensive network of tunnels meticulously built by the Hamas militants, turning the battleground into a nightmare for any invading force.\\n\\nThese tunnels, stretching hundreds of kilometres, have been referred to as the \"metro.\" This hidden challenge has turned Gaza into a nightmarish battlefield for the Israeli military, making an already complicated mission even more treacherous as the 200 hostages are kept in these tunnels.\\n\\nOver 200 hostages are believed to be hidden possibly in a labyrinth that Hamas has built beneath the enclave, even as Israeli warplanes pound the territory ahead of a threatened invasion, killing more than 5,000 Palestinians.\\n\\nThe extensive tunnel network is more than just a threat; it\\'s a lifeline for Hamas. These passages allow the militant group to endure relentless bombardments, move covertly within Gaza, resupply their forces, conceal hostages, and execute surprise attacks.\\n\\nThese tunnels, often reinforced with concrete and reaching astonishing depths, are wired for electricity and communication, enabling Hamas to operate in the shadows, hidden from the watchful eyes above. Resourceful and tactically adept, Hamas considers itself to be a master of asymmetric warfare, where a smaller force can outsmart a numerically stronger opponent, something that could pose huge problems for Israel if it launches a ground offensive within Gaza. Remember, the Hamas know that the Israelis are coming for them and they are prepared for the guerilla warfare inside the tunnels.\\n\\nTo counter this subterranean challenge, Israel has specialised units, such as Yahalom, dedicated to combating underground warfare. In the past they have also deployed bunker busters, which provide a means to engage the enemy from a distance, minimising the risks to their own forces.\\n\\nNow, according to a renowned US journalist, Israeli military leadership is considering inundating the underground tunnels of Hamas before launching a ground invasion into Gaza. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh has written that the Israeli leadership was even willing to sacrifice those who might currently be held hostages in these tunnels.\\n\\nAs Israel prepares to invade the Gaza Strip, many families of hostages seized by Hamas are pleading with the government to rein in the war effort and instead negotiate the release of their loved ones. Highlighting the appalling dilemma facing the whole country, other relatives warn that mediation could take years and say their best hope lies with the military, hoping ground forces could find the missing men, women and children before it is too late.\\n\\nIn the face of this unseen peril, Israel must tread carefully, for beneath the sandy soil of Gaza lies a clandestine world of danger, waiting to confront any who venture below. Tunnel warfare, a historical and persistent tactic, remains a formidable foe, an ever-evolving threat that transcends time and technology.\\n\\nThe decision to launch a ground invasion is now in the hands of the Israeli government, even as pressure builds from its allies over the shape and parameters of the operation.',\n",

Portugal’s foreign ministry made clear it supported his comments on the war, while a spokesperson for the German government told Reuters the Berlin government still has confidence in the U.N. chief.\\n\\nFollowing Hamas’ deadly attacks in early October, Israel has carried out a wave of retaliatory airstrikes and put the Gaza Strip under a “complete siege,” cutting off fuel, electricity and water.\",\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Share post\\n\\nRobin Fleming\\n\\nIn this third and final part of ‘A Deeper Look’ I want to analyse another contemporary instance of blatant and unabashed war crimes being committed by another signatory of the Geneva Conventions, who is also subject to International Humanitarian Law (IHL). That signatory is Turkey, and though it has been receiving less media attention in the shadow of recent events in Israel and Palestine, Turkish armed forces have also been conducting a military campaign that is intentionally and primarily targeting infrastructure in Kurdish-majority regions of North and East Syria (NES).\\n\\nThis is according to Turkey’s own claims. On 4 October, Hakan Fidan, the Turkish foreign minister, warned at the start of the recent operations that, “From now on, all infrastructure, superstructure facilities and energy facilities belonging to PKK/YPG in Iraq and Syria are the legitimate target of our security forces”.\\n\\nThis statement refers to the PKK, or the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, and the YPG, the Peoples’ Protection Units.\\n\\nTurkey considers the PKK, which has its root in southern Turkey, a terrorist organisation, and further more claims that a number of Syrian Kurdish political, civil and military groups are one and the same as the PKK. The YPG, a group led by Syrian Kurds who worked in coordination with the global coalition against ISIS to defeat the terrorist group, have been particularly maligned by Turkey who also refers to them as terrorists.\\n\\nFidan then continued his warning: “I recommend that third parties stay away from PKK/YPG facilities and individuals.”\\n\\nThere is a lot to unpack there. Firstly, it is bizarre a government official such as Fidan would publicly announce his intention to militarily target “infrastructure”, as it is directly prohibited by Article 54 of IHL. Keep in mind, even if as he claims, these facilities are owned by the PKK or YPG, if the facilities are relied on for nonmilitary purposes and to supply water and food stuffs to civilian populations, this is irrefutably a war crime. If the destruction of these facilities leads to ‘starvation or forced displacement’ then Turkeys actions constitute a war crime. Fidan essentially acknowledges civilians could potentially be harmed by the targeting of infrastructure facilities when he warns “third parties to stay away”. Those third party people are civilians. And it is not a civilian’s duty to avoid being in proximity to a bakery, for example, where they may need to buy bread. According to Rule 1 of International Law, the responsibility is on the “armed parties” of a conflict to “distinguish between civilian and combatant”, not on the civilian to make themselves more distinguishable.\\n\\nThe narratives we see at play here are so eerily similar to the narratives Israel is using. Firstly, painting an entire population as equal to one militant group: in Israel’s case Hamas and in Turkey’s the PKK. Secondly, both put responsibility on the civilian to distance themselves from the militant group and claim their hands are clean if there are any casualties. Israel does this by claiming any dead civilian was being used as a ‘human shield’ and so they are not to blame, and Turkey does this by telling ‘third parties’ to steer clear of any infrastructure, even those necessary for sustenance and life, which Turkey deems tainted.\\n\\nNow that we know what Turkey threatened to do, let’s look at what it’s done and the disastrous affects it’s had on the people of NES. Both ReliefWeb, a humanitarian information service, and the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES) have published reports detailing the damage sustained since Turkey began its new bombardment campaign in the beginning of October.\\n\\nThe comprehensive report from the AANES reveals that Turkish armed forces carried out as many as 304 strikes between 4 and 10 October, hitting 224 locations in NES. These strikes consisted of artillery, mortars, drones and airstrikes. According to the report, in this period of time, significant damage was done to power plants, medical centres, oil facilities, industrial areas and also caused “significant material damage” to the vicinity of a number of camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs). In this time, 47 people were killed, and at least 55 injured. Tragically, these numbers are only rising since 10 October.\\n\\nNext I turn to the ReliefWeb report, published 16 October, which lays out the exact extent of the damage, and more importantly the expected impact on the civilian population. For example, the report includes a graphic showing that prior to the Turkish airstrikes, 51.4 percent of electricity needs were able to be supplied from Tabqa Dam, Swediyeh, and Jebsa. After the Turkish airstrikes, the productivity of all of these electricity stations fell dramatically. Meaning now 88.6 percent of the population can not have their needs met. The report says: “With this, only 11 percent of Hasakah governorate’s electricity needs are being met. Some areas — including those reliant on damaged transfer stations — are entirely without electricity.”\\n\\nThis impacts every aspect of daily life. The severe lack of electricity will drastically reduce access to clean and safe water. The Alouk water station was reliant on electricity from one of the damaged stations. Now Alouk is not operational, impacting more than 610,000 civilians in Hasakah and the surrounding areas.\\n\\nA water station providing drinking water to the Malikiyah subdistrict only has access to approximately three hours of electricity per day according to ReliefWeb. As a result, the station is only about to provide water to 12 percent of the city’s population. This is just one of six water stations the report mentioned as having been damaged.\\n\\nI will take the time now to remind you of the second point in Article 54 of IHL. “It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as… drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works.” Turkey’s actions, within such a short time frame, impacted hundreds of thousands of civilians’ access to water in just one region of NES. It is not within Hakan Fidan’s power to declare that this infrastructure is now a “legitimate target” as he tried to do on 4 October, no matter what he says, Turkeys actions are demonstrably in violation with both the spirit and letter of IHL.\\n\\nAs heartbreaking as seeing this destruction on any civilian area is, as we see in Gaza and in NES, what makes it even worse is the complete failure of other signatories of the Geneva Convention, and other countries sworn to uphold the principles of international humanitarian law to prevent these violations from occurring. Civilian causalities have become so normalised in modern warfare, all an aggressor needs is to blame the civilians themselves for their proximity to “legitimate targets”. What is clear is that we need a renewal of commitment to the principle of IHL. We, the international community, need to re-imagine it and strengthen it so it is not so easy to ignore the cries and the suffering of innocent civilians.\\n\\nRobin Fleming is an American Researcher who worked with the Rojava Information Centre and specialises in North and East Syria.',\n",

Of those, 19 – 15 at al-Asad Air Base in Iraq and four at al-Tanf Garrison in Syria – have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI), Ryder said.\\n\\nAll have since returned to duty, he added, and there have been “no injuries or no reported cases of TBI since the 17th and 18th of October.”\\n\\nAn attack on Thursday, Ryder said, targeted Erbil Airbase and was “unsuccessful” with no casualties and “some minor damage to infrastructure.”\\n\\nThe announcement on Thursday comes after the Pentagon put roughly 2,000 US troops on prepare to deploy orders last week, which Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said were focused on providing “air defense, security, logistics, medical, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and transportation” support.\\n\\nThat is in addition to US troops already in Iraq and Syria – roughly 2,500 and 900, respectively – and Navy assets that were announced to be heading to the region. The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group has been directed to the Middle East, and the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group is currently in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.\\n\\nAsked Thursday to explain the delay in response to attacks on US forces, Ryder said the US military maintains “the inherent right of defending our troops and we will take all necessary measures to protect our forces and our interests overseas.”\\n\\n“As it relates to these groups, again, we know that these are Iranian-backed militia groups that are supported by Iran, and of course, we hold Iran responsible for these groups,” he said.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'WASHINGTON — In the midst of two active and potentially world-changing conflicts in the Middle East and Europe, the U.S. is hoping to find at least a small measure of common ground with China as China’s top diplomat visits Washington this week.\\n\\nOver three days of meetings that begin Thursday, top Biden administration officials, including possibly the president himself, will press Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the importance of China stepping up its role on the world stage if it wants to be considered a responsible major international player.\\n\\nRead More: How China Could Play a Key Role in the Israel-Hamas War—and Why It’s Not\\n\\nMore From TIME\\n\\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken and Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, are both expected to urge China to play a constructive role in both the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine wars. Those meetings could set the stage for a summit between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping next month on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum leaders gathering in San Francisco.\\n\\nThe U.S. has been disappointed with China over its support for Russia in the war against Ukraine and its relative silence on the Middle East. In addition, the world’s two largest economies are at odds on issues such as human rights, climate change, Taiwan, the South China Sea, and North Korea.\\n\\nStill, both sides have expressed a willingness to talk with each other since Blinken canceled a planned visit to China in February after the shootdown of a Chinese spy balloon over the U.S., which marked a low point in recent relations.\\n\\nRead More: The Chinese Spy Balloon Has Inflated America’s Paranoia\\n\\nIn the months that followed that crisis, however, Blinken rescheduled his trip and went to China in June. He was followed in quick succession by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, climate envoy John Kerry, and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\\n\\nIn addition, Sullivan met with Wang in Malta in mid-September ahead of Blinken’s discussions with Chinese Vice President Han Zheng later that month on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. And Blinken spoke just last week with Wang about the Israel-Hamas crisis.\\n\\nThe goal, according to U.S. officials, is to set the stage for another Biden-Xi summit at which the two leaders could explore cooperation or at least easing outright hostility on the most pressing matters of the day.\\n\\n“Wang Yi’s visit will serve as one of the final touchpoints in laying the groundwork” for the Biden-Xi meeting, said Ryan Hass, director of the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institute, a Washington-based think tank. “Wang’s meetings in Washington will set the contours for the topics the two leaders will discuss when they meet in November.”\\n\\n“It opens the possibility of the world’s two largest powers pursuing coordinated efforts to limit escalation or expansion of violence in Ukraine and the Middle East,” he said.\\n\\nYun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, another Washington think tank, said Wang’s trip signals that the Xi-Biden summit is almost certain.\\n\\n“Wang is here to pave the ground for Xi’s San Francisco trip. That’s the core focus of the trip. It means issues will be negotiated, solutions will be discussed and details will be deliberated and inked,” Sun said. “The APEC summit is 20 days away, so time is of essence. His trip means that Xi is coming. Xi’s coming means meeting with Biden. The Xi-Biden summit means efforts to stabilize bilateral ties.”\\n\\nRead More: The World’s Future Is in the Hands of Chinese President Xi Jinping\\n\\nScott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Wang’s trip could yield results such as additional direct flights between the two countries, visas for more journalists, and even agreements on climate change and resumption of high-level military dialogue.\\n\\nBut while it is important for Wang and the Americans to discuss points of contention in the Indo-Pacific region and elsewhere, Kennedy said it is unlikely the two sides will reach much agreement.\\n\\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry said Wang will “have in-depth exchanges of views” with U.S. officials on a range of issues and “state China’s principled position and legitimate concerns” on relations between the two countries.\\n\\nThe Chinese president last came to the U.S. in 2017, when former President Donald Trump hosted him at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Biden, who took office in 2021, has yet to host Xi on U.S. soil. The two men last met in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022, on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting of leading rich and developing nations.\\n\\nWang’s trip is one of a string of meetings and activities to warm up Xi’s visit to the U.S.\\n\\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is visiting China this week, had a surprise meeting with Xi on Wednesday in Beijing. The Chinese president told the governor that “the achievements of China-U.S. relations have not come easily and should be cherished all the more,” according to the official news agency Xinhua.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer led a delegation of six senators to China, in the first visit by U.S. lawmakers since 2019. Schumer was also received by Xi, who said the Thucydides Trap is “not inevitable.” The Thucydides Trap is a political term for the tendency of major clashes when an emerging power challenges an existing power.\\n\\nRead More: U.S. General’s Prediction of War With China ‘in 2025’ Risks Turning Worst Fears Into Reality\\n\\nThe U.S.-China relationship began to sour in 2018 when the Trump administration slapped hefty tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. It deteriorated further over a range of issues, including rights abuses, the South China Sea, Taiwan, technology, and the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",

NSO Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe way that NSO's Pegasus technology works means it can be remotely installed and operated on specific iOS and Android phones. Once a phone is compromised, then Pegasus allows the operator to spy on the phone's messages, hear calls and use location tracking.\\n\\nSome 200 people, including several Americans, are believed to have been taken by Hamas into Gaza during the group's Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which left over 1,300 people dead. To date, four of the hostages are known to have been freed.\\n\\nIsraeli newspaper Ha’aretz also reported several other cybersecurity companies are involved in the search, including Rayzone, Paragon and Candiru. Ha’aretz cited intelligence sources who said the firms are collaborating closely to locate the hostages.\",\n",

While Indian fact-checkers have pointed out thousands of misleading tweets and claims in favour of Israel since the Hamas attack on Israel, now on the global level, it is being noticed.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Twitter handle Frida Khan claimed that she is an Al Jazeera journalist. She tweeted after Israel bombed Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza, killing more than 1000 people including children, “I am Al Jazeera Journalist Farida Khan working in Khan Younis, Gaza. I saw with my own eyes that it was the Hamas “Ayyash 250” Rocket. It was Hamas misfired Rocket. Al Jazeera is lying.

We want to clarify: This account has no ties to Al Jazeera, its views, or content. Exercise caution, verify information prior to publishing (sic).”\\n\\nAfter Al Jazeera’s tweet, Farida Khan deleted her first and later account.\\n\\nIndian fact-checker and Co-founder of Alt News, Mohammed Zubair then pointed out that not only the claim of Farida Khan that she works for Al Jazeera, but her account is fake. The account is of someone from India and it is not of a girl as the name suggests.\\n\\nZubair has already debunked thousands of fake tweets and accounts which were falsely claimed in favour of Israel. He also showed, how an old video of 2022 is being shared as Hamas misfired a rocket on a hospital in Gaza.\\n\\nHe also pointed out that right wing troll accounts like @Smokingskills07, which mocks the minor victims in Gaza, is followed by women and child development minister Smriti Irani and several BJP MPs.\\n\\nAnother fact check organization BOOM Live debunked a fake tweet on October 18 by an Indian handler. “A photo of a list of 17 Nepali nationals who were either killed or injured in Kibbutz Alumim during the recent #Hamas attack is being shared with a false claim that they are names of Indian citizens kidnapped by the Islamic militant group (sic)”.\\n\\nThere are thousands of fake handles and tweets in support of the Israeli military’s propaganda doing rounds. The biggest was that Hamas beheaded forty babies. Which misled media houses as well as American President Joe Biden.\\n\\nOn October 13, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the US Representative, NY-14 (BX & Queens) tweeted, “The level of misinformation in all directions at this moment is incredibly high, especially on this platform. If you see a claim, photo, or video that triggers a strong emotional reaction, take a moment to pause and check for veracity/confirmation from multiple sources (sic)”. She did not mention any particular country, from where it is being originated, maybe it was not her work.\\n\\nBut a day ahead, fact-checker Pratik Sinha said that now the world would have realized how the Indian right wing has made India the disinformation capital of the world. Sinha tweeted, “With India now exporting its disinformation actors in the Indian mainstream media and on social media in support of Israel, hopefully the world will now realise how the Indian right-wing has made India the disinformation capital of the world. The disinformation originating from India that fact-checkers globally are having to contend with, Indian fact-checkers have been dealing with that every day for several years now (sic).”',\n",

On Thursday, a Pentagon spokesman said at least 12 separate attacks have occurred in Iraq and four more in Syria since Oct. 17. The latest, at the air base near Irbil, Iraq, happened after Biden’s remarks.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nA senior administration official, who like some others interviewed for this report spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. government calculations, said that “nothing has changed about our prerogatives” to protect deployed service members, but “we’re also not blind to the fact that there are other forces at work now, and we want to be informed by what else is going on in the region.”\\n\\nAs the administration has surged combat power and defensive equipment to the Middle East, Republicans in Congress have implored Biden to respond to the attacks. They were joined on Wednesday by retired Gen. Joseph Votel, whose final posting, as the head of U.S. Central Command, afforded him firsthand insight into Iran’s support for militia groups throughout the Middle East. Votel, whose reputation as a nonpartisan military commander earned him admirers in Democratic and GOP administrations, said during an online panel discussion that the United States has “unfortunately” allowed the attacks to become “a little bit of a norm” by not responding to them uniformly.\\n\\n“We will have to do that,” Votel said. “I think we are at the point where we can probably do that now, and we should.” With the additional military assets dispatched to the region, he added, “we can and should respond more directly to these threats on our troops.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIranian proxies have harassed deployed U.S. forces for years, flying self-detonating drones into remote outposts and, at times, provoking an American response. That happened in March, when Biden directed retaliatory airstrikes after an American contractor was killed and other U.S. personnel were wounded by such an attack in Syria. The president said then that Tehran should “be prepared for us to act forcefully to protect our people.”\\n\\nThe deliberations now are complicated by the Oct. 7 cross-border rampage in Israel by Hamas militants based in Gaza. The assault killed more than 1,400, compelling Israel to declare war. Hamas is part of the broader network receiving training and weapons from Iran, prompting concerns that other heavily armed proxy forces, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, could join the conflict.\\n\\nRep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), an Iraq War veteran, said in an interview that the Middle East is a “tinderbox” at the moment, putting at odds the administration’s mandate to protect American troops with its efforts to avoid being drawn into a larger conflict in which U.S. forces also could be at risk. Biden and his top advisers, are “walking a fine line quite well,” he said, but the situation could change at any moment.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“Given the volatility in the region today, I think it’s unwise for any U.S. officials to publicly declare a line in the sand,” he said. “There are clearly entities in the Middle East that want a war, and we don’t want to play into that.”\\n\\nSenior Pentagon officials this week have warned that they see the prospect for “significant escalation” against U.S. personnel across the Middle East in coming days. The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait underscored that point on Wednesday, issuing an alert that said U.S. officials were aware of threats made on social media by Alwiyat al-Waad al-Haq, an Iraq-based militia with ties to Iranian-backed actors that have claimed numerous attacks against U.S. troops. “U.S. citizens,” it stated, “are advised to remain alert.”\\n\\nKenneth “Frank” McKenzie, a retired Marine Corps general who led Central Command from 2019 to 2022, said the infusion of U.S. firepower into the region, including the deployment of two aircraft carrier strike groups and additional air-defense units and fighter squadrons, should send a very clear message to Iran.\\n\\n“Our posture in the region is getting significantly more powerful every day, and they’re going to pay attention to that,” McKenzie said.\\n\\nLike Votel, McKenzie attributed the rise in attacks on U.S. forces in part to the decision not to routinely address earlier incidents. It’s likely, he added, that Central Command will develop options to do so, and then it will be up to Biden whether and how the United States responds.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“The Iranians tend to push until someone pushes back,” McKenzie said. “I would think that, at some point, you would want to push back — but that’s not a military decision.” He stopped short of echoing Votel’s call to do so now.\\n\\nWith the recent proxy attacks, Iran is testing the United States and looking for vulnerabilities, said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. From Tehran’s perspective, he said, “there’s really no downside” to doing so as the United States says that it wants to avoid a broad regional war.\\n\\nBowman, an Afghanistan war veteran, said one sensible approach might be to launch airstrikes specifically at militias in Syria, to prevent Iranian officials from stirring up domestic politics against the United States in Iraq. There are about 900 American troops in Syria and another 2,500 in Iraq, with both groups focused on preventing a resurgence of the Islamic State group.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Israel is on the verge of introducing a groundbreaking tactical tool, referred to as the “sponge bomb,” in its ongoing efforts to counteract the complex network of underground tunnels used by Hamas in Gaza.\\n\\nThese specialized devices are encased within a protective plastic container featuring a precisely engineered metal barrier that divides two distinct liquids. When the moment arises, a trained soldier activates the “sponge bomb,” allowing these liquids to merge as it advances towards its intended destination.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have ingeniously designed these “sponge bombs” to serve a very particular purpose. Unlike traditional explosive devices, they do not inflict harm through explosions. Instead, they work by promptly sealing any gaps or tunnel openings that might be exploited by hostile combatants.\\n\\nAlso Read Border situation remains stable: Army Chief Gen Manoj Pande\\n\\nDetails concerning the deployment of these enigmatic “sponge bombs” have been closely guarded by the IDF. Upon activation, they produce a rapid and expanding foam, which swiftly hardens to achieve its desired effect.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the year 2021, the IDF exhibited the deployment of these ingenious devices during comprehensive training exercises. These exercises involved the creation of a simulated tunnel system at the Tze’Elim army base, strategically situated near the Gaza border. The primary aim was to prepare IDF personnel to navigate and counteract the subterranean passages effectively.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the IDF prepares for a forthcoming ground operation, the significance of the challenge becomes apparent. The sprawling labyrinth of tunnels, colloquially known as the “Gaza Metro,” stretches over hundreds of miles, providing shelter and camouflage to Hamas fighters and their leadership.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe “sponge bomb” is poised to emerge as a vital asset for the IDF. Its capacity to seal off tunnel entrances and prevent surprise attacks is a crucial defensive measure. These specialized devices come stored in a compact plastic container featuring a strategically positioned metal partition, ensuring the two essential liquids remain separate. Only when deployed by a well-trained soldier, this partition is removed, allowing the liquids to mix as the “bomb” is propelled towards its intended target.\\n\\nAlso Read Chanakya Defence Dialogue of Indian Army: Strengthening Strategic Insights\\n\\nTo address this intricate challenge, the IDF has formed specialized tunnel reconnaissance units within the engineering corps. These units are equipped with an array of cutting-edge tools, including ground-penetrating radar, both aerial and ground sensors, and advanced drilling systems.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecent reports indicate that IDF personnel have been furnished with specialized equipment to facilitate underground visibility. Given the absence of natural light in the underground environment, troops are now reliant on thermal technology for night vision, supplemented by specially designed radios capable of reliable communication in these challenging conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition to these measures, Israel is actively exploring the use of drones and robots to navigate the complex tunnel network. However, deploying these technologies underground has posed significant technical challenges.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe introduction of the “sponge bomb” and these highly specialized tools represents a concerted effort by Israel to adapt and respond effectively to the evolving threats posed by underground tunnel networks. These endeavours are part of a broader strategy to ensure the safety and security of Israeli soldiers as they confront the complex and perilous reality of the “Gaza Strip.”',\n",

According to a statement from the IDF provided to media, over 400 targets were struck in Gaza and several Hamas commanders were killed.\\n\\nOn Monday evening strikes also targeted a number of Hamas commanders who operate air defenses in Gaza, including surface-to-air missiles. In addition, strikes took out the head of an anti-tank missile team in Gaza, the IDF said. The Chief of Staff of the IDF Lt. Gen. Herzi HaLevi said that the goal is to dismantle Hamas by targeting its leaders, branches of the organization and infrastructure.\\n\\n“That is why we are striking and eliminating high ranking commanders and members, destroying infrastructure, and acting with great determination. The path is a path of unrelenting attacks, damaging Hamas everywhere and in every way,” HaLevi said.\\n\\nIsrael has concentrated attacks in the northern Gaza Strip and has warned residents to leave this area over the last two weeks. Gaza is densely populated and the request for people to covers approximately one million people. Israel has been preparing a ground operation for two weeks, deploying tanks and infantry units on the border of Gaza and declaring a vast area as closed military zone. This includes evacuating 53 Israeli communities that border the Gaza Strip, to a depth of 5 miles inside Israel, which includes 34,000 people and another 30,000 from the city of Sderot.\\n\\nIsrael called up 300,000 reservists in the wake of the surprise Oct. 7 attack. The IDF is conducting training and refresher courses for the soldiers, including practicing urban combat scenarios and working with the soldiers on tactics such as clearing houses. If a ground incursion takes place, the soldiers will be operating in areas that are a mix of fields and built-up areas, as well as dense urban areas in Gaza city. The IDF said that it struck areas in the neighborhoods of Shuja’iyya, Shati, Jabalia, Daraj Tuffah, and Zaytun according to a briefing by IDF spokesperson Read Admiral Daniel Hagari. This includes key areas in northern Gaza.\\n\\nAt the same time, Hezbollah continues to threaten Israel with anti-tank missiles on the northern border. An anti-tank missile was fired at Shtula, a small community that sits on hills along the border with Lebanon. Shtula had also been hit in the first week of the war, destroying a vehicle, killing one person and wounding others. This is one of many uses of anti-tank fire by Hezbollah over the first two weeks of the war. In addition the IDF said it carried out a strike against a “terrorist [who] attempted to launch a rocket from Lebanon towards Israeli territory adjacent to the area of Kibbutz Bar’am.”\\n\\nIsrael has also evacuated 42 communities along the northern border, though many communities have local security and support in attempt to keep small businesses running. The clashes in the north and south come as French president Emanuel Macron visited Israel on Tuesday. It also takes place amid continued focus on the 220 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Hamas released two hostages on Monday evening. One of them provided details of how she was transported through tunnels in Gaza.\\n\\nReporting from Israel, Seth J.

       " {'articleBody': 'A number of drone attacks on US bases in Syria and Iraq, coming in the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, are raising fears about a war breaking out across the region.\\n\\nAccording to the Pentagon, 21 servicemen have reported minor injuries and one civilian contractor died of a heart attack in attacks from Iran-backed groups that began on 17 October.\\n\\nOn Friday, the US hit back by striking weapons and ammunition facilities in Syria used by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps and militia groups after an order from President Joe Biden.\\n\\nLet’s take a closer look at how tensions are raising fears of war breaking out in the region.\\n\\nWhat happened?\\n\\nIran-backed groups are continuously attacking US and coalition troops in Iraq and Syria.\\n\\nThe White House on Monday said the US had recorded “an uptick in rocket and drone attacks by Iranian-backed proxy groups against military bases housing US personnel in Iraq and Syria”.\\n\\nIt added that it is “deeply concerned about the potential for any significant escalation of these attacks in the days ahead”.\\n\\nIran backs a number of outfits in the region including Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hezbollah.\\n\\nAccording to Reuters, there have been at least 19 attacks on bases.\\n\\nNBC News quoted Pentagon press secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder as saying the strikes were a “mix of one way attack drones and rockets.”\\n\\nThe 21 US military personnel suffered minor injuries, but all have since returned to duty.\\n\\nTime Magazine reported that the Islamic Resistance in Iraq put up a number of videos on Telegram of drones flying into the desert sky.\\n\\nThe videos are accompanied by texts that warn of more strikes and asking the public to keep away from military bases.\\n\\nWhile the outlet could not confirm the veracity of the videos, it cited metadata as showing that the videos matched the days when US bases were attacked.\\n\\nWhile the Pentagon has no proof Iran directly ordered the attacks, a senior official told Time Magazine, “It’s fair to say when you see this uptick in activity and attacks by many of these groups, there’s Iranian fingerprints all over it.”\\n\\nWhile the number of groups backed by Iran in the region remains unclear, Time Magazine quoted experts as saying it falls between 10 and 20.\\n\\n“There’s at least 10 or 20, if not many more groups between the Iraq-Syria border alone,” Behnam Ben Taleblu, an Iran expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told the outlet.\\n\\nA source told CNN that Tehran’s influence over the groups cannot be denied but that whether these groups are acting on their own remains an open question.\\n\\nThe US, which has backed Israel but called for humanitarian aid for Gaza, has warned of more strikes if the Iran-backed groups don’t halt their attacks.\\n\\n‘Unacceptable and must stop’\\n\\nThe US air strikes took place at roughly 4:30 am on Friday near Abu Kamal, a Syrian town on the border with Iraq, and were carried out by two F-16 fighter jets using precision munitions, a US defence official said.\\n\\n“These precision self-defence strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against US personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on 17 October,” US defense secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement.\\n\\n“These Iranian-backed attacks against US forces are unacceptable and must stop,” Austin said.\\n\\nBiden has sent a rare message to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warning Tehran against targeting US personnel in West Asia, the White House said earlier on Thursday.\\n\\n“My warning to the ayatollah was that if they continue to move against those troops, we will respond, and he should be prepared,” Biden was quoted as saying by Al Jazeera.\\n\\nThe US president added that it has “nothing to do” with Israel.\\n\\n“There was a direct message relayed. That’s as far as I’m going to go,” US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters, declining to say how it was delivered.\\n\\n“What we want is for Iran to take very specific actions, to direct its militias and proxies to stand down,” a senior US defence official said.\\n\\nThe United States did not coordinate the air strikes with Israel, the official added.\\n\\nAustin also sought to distance the strikes against facilities used by the IRGC in Syria from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas members in Gaza.\\n\\n“These narrowly tailored strikes in self-defence were intended solely to protect and defend US personnel in Iraq and Syria,” he said.\\n\\n“They are separate and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, and do not constitute a shift in our approach to the Israel-Hamas conflict,” he added.\\n\\nThe United States has sent warships and fighter aircraft to the region over the last three weeks. On Thursday the Pentagon said about 900 more US troops have arrived in West Asia or are heading there to bolster air defences for US personnel.\\n\\nIran, meanwhile, has said it cannot stand idly by while Israel bombs Gaza.\\n\\nIran’s foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian warned at the United Nations on Thursday that if Israel’s retaliation against Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip doesn’t end then the United States will “not be spared from this fire.”\\n\\nCNN quoted Amirabdollahian as saying that the region is currently a “powder keg.”\\n\\n“Any miscalculation in continuing genocide and forced displacement can have serious and bitter consequences, both in the region and for the warmongers,” Abdollahian warned.\\n\\n“If crimes against humanity do not stop immediately, there is the possibility at any moment that the region will go out of control,” he added.\\n\\nWhat do experts say?\\n\\nThat Washington is walking a tightrope.\\n\\nSpeaking to The Guardian, Charles Lister, director of the Syria and countering terrorism and extremism programmes at Washington’s Middle East Institute said: “The US has now had two dozen soldiers injured. In any other conditions it would have responded but its hands are tied because it does not want to be blamed for escalating. The US government is very concerned that we are walking into a regional crisis.”\\n\\n“The attacks show that Iran has an extensive network of well-armed, aggressive and well-coordinated proxies across the region which it has established for exactly this scenario. They are currently testing redlines but not pushing too hard. They are putting the onus on the US to respond.”\\n\\nTobias Borck, a senior research fellow in Middle East security studies at London’s Royal United Services Institute, warned that Iran was “literally playing with fire”.\\n\\n“What we are seeing is the next level out from the Gazan war. This is all carefully calibrated to show solidarity. Iran is saying: we see the aircraft carriers but we are not scared and we can hurt you too. It is incredibly dangerous,” Borck added.\\n\\n“A lot of people want to understand it as Tehran pulling the strings but … actually these are partners who share a worldview and ideology. One element is claiming the mantle of leading the opposition to a western-imposed order in the region.”\\n\\nAfshon Ostovar, an associate professor at the Naval Postgraduate School, told Time Magazine, “You don’t launch rockets and missiles and armed drones into populated areas such as bases without a willingness to kill.”\\n\\n“And if you’re going to commit lethal attacks, the escalatory ladder or dynamic that follows is never a sure thing.”\\n\\nRyder warned that things might get worse.\\n\\n“What we are seeing is the prospect for more significant escalation against US forces and personnel across the region in the very near term coming from Iranian proxy forces, and ultimately from Iran,” Ryder was quoted as saying by NBC News.\\n\\n“We always reserve the right to defend ourselves and we will never hesitate to take action when needed to protect our forces and our interests overseas,” he added.\\n\\nWith inputs from agencies',\n",

EU leaders, he said, agreed that they want to bring positive influence and think that the political process is extremely important. The EU’s leaders, he emphasised, took the time to discuss the two-state solution and support the principle of holding very soon a peace conference. Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said it’s important to keep in mind that it all started with a horrible attack by Hamas terrorists on the people of Israel, and that it is important to acknowledge the pain and suffering of the Israeli people, if we want to speak to Israel and influence Israel.

We will have our next two flights – they are scheduled for today, Friday – and more are planned over the following days. The Commission will also sign new contracts with UN agencies, as part of putting new funding to use. Von der Leyen also said leaders discussed “the real risk of regionalisation of the conflict.” “We need to continue working intensively with partners,” she added, highlighting Egypt in particular. “The current situation reinforces our determination to work on a comprehensive and [mutually] beneficial partnership with Egypt,” the Commission chief said. It is important for us to have Egypt as a beacon of stability in that region. The heads of state and government discussed the issue of online hate speech and antisemitism, von der Leyen said. Addressing the issue of the bloc’s long-term budget, the Commission chief listed extra support for Ukraine, migration, natural disasters and competitiveness – in particular clean tech – as priorities that require more funding.

After five hours of meetings in Brussels led by the leaders of France, Germany and Italy it appeared progress was being made with Kosovo agreeing to sign up a new framework to manage the north of the country in which the majority of the population is Serbian. The deal would have allowed an element of self-management of the region where about 60,000 people live following a fresh proposal for a solution by a high-powered EU and US delegation that visited both capitals on Saturday. In a statement, Kosovo said it accepted the EU proposal dating from February and a supplementary deal known as the “Ohrid annex” signed in March. But Jeton Zulfaj, political adviser to the prime minister, Albin Kurti, said the president of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić had refused to sign up to the EU proposals. “Today Prime Minister Albin Kurti offered to sign the agreement for the third time, now with the Annex and with EU-US proposal for self- management. Vucic refused. “It is clear that Serbia does not want normalisations of relations with Kosova nor self-management for Kosova Serbs,” he said.

He is currently taking shelter in his home next to the MSF office in Gaza City with his family and children. Today, Loay, like many others, is without food, water or electricity. He shares in his own words the desperate situation on the ground.\\n\\n“The situation here is very difficult. We do not have electricity, water, or Internet. There is no safe place here and the situation is extremely difficult: no safety, no bread, no water, and no electricity since the beginning of the war up until now. God help us in this difficult time.\\n\\nAt this moment, we do not have any drinkable water; the water we have is polluted and not safe to drink. We don’t even have fuel to pump the water wells. Our families are going through very difficult times. There is no safe place amid the bombings. Our families and kids are being displaced from the north to the south and from the south to anywhere else. We do not have any safe place to stay.\\n\\nWe delivered medical supplies to Al Shifa hospital in Gaza City two days ago. The movement to the hospital was very tough, we saw hundreds of people taking shelter inside the hospital and it was difficult to walk inside. It took us a lot of time to deliver the supplies.\\n\\nThere were huge numbers of people inside the hospital; they think the hospital is a safe place, but there is no safe place. The majority of the injuries are very critical.\\n\\nThere is not enough space. There are some patients who need surgeries, and they are laying on the ground due to the high number of people in the hospital.\\n\\nI decided to stay in my home because there is no safe place in Gaza. My house is close to the MSF office and clinic.\\n\\nThe majority of my family decided to move to the centre of Gaza and to the south. A large number of the people who moved to the south are returning now to their homes, because they have suffered a lot being homeless. Again: no electricity, no water and the situation is extremely tense for people in the south.\\n\\nI am still working on a daily basis in the burn clinic with MSF. We still receive some patients with burns. I do the dressings for them. It is difficult for them to come back again so I prepare kits for them and I show them on how to do it themselves. This is at least something I can help with as a nurse.”\\n\\nAbout MSF in Palestine\\n\\nThe information about our response, below, is correct as of Oct. 26, 2023\\n\\nMSF activities in Gaza are currently very limited. We have extreme difficulties delivering aid and providing healthcare due to the insecurity and the unpredictability of the bombardments. While some of our colleagues decided to move south following the unacceptable evacuation order of north Gaza, some of our other colleagues have remained in northern Gaza and continue to support in lifesaving activities in Al Shifa Hospital as well in Al Nasser hospital in the south. In Al Awda hospital, a team of seven MSF staff is also working in the MSF inpatient department.\\n\\nWe are also supporting local health authorities with donations from our medical stock. Due to the huge and uninterrupted influx of wounded people since the beginning of the current active conflict, Al Shifa Hospital, the main surgical facility in the Gaza strip, was on the brink of a complete shortage of essential medicines. In response, we recently were finally able to make a large donation of medical stock, including medicines and medical equipment to Al Shifa hospital.\\n\\nOur staff are working hard on preparing medical and humanitarian supplies to be sent to Gaza when safe access will be guaranteed and open, and we’ll send in emergency teams if and when we’re able to.\\n\\nMSF is committed to supporting the people affected by the Israeli heavy bombardments and indiscriminate attacks on Gaza. We stand in solidarity with healthcare workers and patients in Gaza. We want to be able to access people in need of medical care and offer lifesaving humanitarian services, but to do this we need basic guarantees of safety.\\n\\nThe West Bank\\n\\nSince the start of the current conflict, our teams in Hebron, Nablus and Jenin have been actively assessing the medical needs in the West Bank, as violence there is escalating.

       " {'articleBody': 'The Israel-Hamas war enters its 20th day, almost three weeks after Hamas carried out a deadly assault on southern Israel that left at least 1,300 Israelis slaughtered and more than 3,300 people wounded on October 7. Some 220 people – more than half of whom are foreign nationals – are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza.\\n\\nIsrael responded with heavy aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip, which according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry has left at least 6,546 Gazans dead – including 2,704 children. 17,439 Gazans have been wounded since the start of the war. A slow trickle of humanitarian aid has entered the Strip in recent days, after Israel imposed a siege on the enclave, cutting electricity, water and fuel.\\n\\nHere\\'s what you need to know:\\n\\n■ The release of a large number of hostages from Hamas captivity in Gaza may happen within a few days, according to Israeli and foreign sources familiar with negotiations on the matter.\\n\\nOne of the sources said that the parties hope to finalize the deal \"within two days, maybe even less,\" and that whether it comes to pass depends on progress in negotiations with Hamas.\\n\\n■ House Speaker Mike Johnson said the first bill he will bring to the floor is a resolution \"in support of our dear friend Israel and we are overdue in getting that done.\" Nearly 400 lawmakers co-sponsored a resolution condemning the Hamas attack in the immediate aftermath of October 7, condemning \"the barbaric war launched by Hamas\" and calling on all countries to condemn the organization.\\n\\nIt further calls upon Hamas to cease its attacks, release hostages and return bodies of the deceased, as well as avowing continued commitment to maintaining U.S. aid, enforcing the Taylor Force Act and urging the full enforcement of sanctions against Iran.\\n\\n■ A Jerusalem man was arrested today for hanging a sign on his balcony with the inscription \"No Sanctity in an Occupied City,\" alongside a Palestinian flag placed in a flowerpot.\\n\\nThe police received reports of the declaration and the flag, leading officers to arrive at the residence in the city center. Attorney Naser Odeh, who represents the young man, stated that the police arrived at the scene after a crowd gathered under the man\\'s apartment and shouted derogatory slogans responding to the sign.\\n\\n■ The Israel Defense Forces intercepted a surface-to-air missile fired from Lebanon towards an IDF drone. In response, the Israeli Air Force is attacking the area from which the missile was fired.\\n\\n■ The World Health Organization is \"gravely concerned\" about the condition of Israeli hostages captured by Hamas during the October 7 attack, calling for their immediate release and urgent access to each of them and delivery of medical care.\\n\\n\"There is an urgent need for the captors of the hostages to provide signs of life, proof of provision of health care and the immediate release, on humanitarian and health grounds, of all those abducted,\" said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\\n\\n■ Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Wednesday that Israel\\'s conflict with Hamas could spread well beyond the Middle East and said it was wrong that innocent women, children and old people in Gaza were being punished for other people\\'s crimes.\\n\\nPutin, who made the comments in a Kremlin meeting with Russian religious leaders of different faiths, said bloodshed in the region had to stop. He said he told other world leaders in phone calls that if it did not, there was a risk of a much wider conflagration.\\n\\nPutin said: \"Our task today, our main task, is to stop the bloodshed and violence,\" said Putin, according to a Kremlin transcript of the meeting... Otherwise, further escalation of the crisis is fraught with grave and extremely dangerous and destructive consequences. And not only for the Middle East region. It could spill over far beyond the borders of the Middle East.\"',\n",

Those horrendous attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people. — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) October 25, 2023\\n\\nA high-level session of the UN Security Council was held Tuesday, during which Israel’s Foreign Minister Eli Cohen dismissed calls for “proportionality” in the country’s response to Hamas’s attack on 7 October while the Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyadh al-Maliki demanded an end to the fighting.\\n\\nThe UN Secretary-General, meanwhile, alleged violations of international law in Gaza and noted that the attacks by Hamas “did not happen in a vacuum”. This drew a sharp response from Israel’s foreign minister who asked Guterres: “Mr Secretary-General, in what world do you live?”\\n\\nShortly after, Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan — who was detained briefly last month after protesting during Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi’s address at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) — called for Guterres’s resignation.\\n\\n“The UN Secretary-General, who shows understanding for the campaign of mass murder of children, women, and the elderly, is not fit to lead the UN. I call on him to resign immediately,” Erdan wrote on X. He added that there is no point in speaking to people who “show compassion for the most terrible atrocities”.\\n\\nThe @UN Secretary-General, who shows understanding for the campaign of mass murder of children, women, and the elderly, is not fit to lead the UN.

Hamas has released four of the approximately 200 Israelis who were taken hostage during the attacks.\\n\\nAlso Read: Gulf & ASEAN countries hold key summit in Riyadh, call for ceasefire in Gaza\\n\\nConflicting views on ceasefire at United Nations\\n\\nThe Israel-Hamas conflict continues to divide the UN, especially when it comes to calls for a ceasefire.\\n\\nWhile the world body and voices from Europe including EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell have repeatedly called for a temporary halt to the fighting, Israel and the US have rejected such calls.\\n\\nIsrael argues that it has every right to defend itself while the US worries a ceasefire would benefit Hamas. A halt in fighting would give Hamas “the ability to rest, to refit and to get ready to continue launching terrorist attacks against Israel,” US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters Monday.\\n\\nAt the special meeting at the UNSC, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Washington’s draft resolution to the UN, proposed last Saturday, will build on many points proposed by Brazil’s resolution last week.\\n\\nNotably, the US had vetoed that resolution. Twelve other council members voted in favour, including two permanent members (China and France) while the UK and Russia abstained.\\n\\nIn his remarks Tuesday, Blinken argued that acts of terrorism must be denounced whether they target people in Nairobi “or Mumbai”, citing ISIS, Lashkar-e Taiba (LeT) and Hamas as examples of terror groups.\\n\\nThe US’s proposed resolution makes four points: the right of countries to defend themselves against terrorism, protections of civilians, preventing the conflict from spreading and the need for an “enduring” political solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. A vote on the draft resolution is expected to be held this week.\\n\\nFirst, to recognize the right of any nation to defend themselves against terrorism. Second, to protect civilians. Third, to prevent the conflict from spreading. Fourth, to build an enduring political solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. — Matthew Miller (@StateDeptSpox) October 24, 2023\\n\\nBlinken did not mention the word “ceasefire” in his remarks.\\n\\nReports also say that the Arab League objected to many points in the US’s draft resolution. Speaking to Ahram Online earlier this week, the Arab League’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Majed Abdul-Fattah, said member countries objected to “the lack of a clear call for an immediate ceasefire” and the classification of Hamas as a terror group.\\n\\nThe Arab League represents 22 member countries, including Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, among others.\\n\\n(Edited by Amrtansh Arora)\\n\\nAlso Read: Israel-India spy diplomacy was almost derailed by ping-pong over table tennis contest visas in 1987',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'The wide slivers of plastic snap in the invisible wind that whistles through a long corridor closed off by slabs of cement eight meters high. Slivers of plastic and slabs of cement at Erez are the funerary monument of the Oslo Accords and of an ideal of economic development that had once seemed to be emerging over the horizon. This ideal had been realised in those Israeli industrial zones that had arisen in border areas, where Palestinians arrived from Gaza in the morning, provided cheap labour, then returned to the Strip in the evening. Then, when the conflict became even harsher at the outbreak of the Second Intifada, queues of Palestinians – in ever-dwindling numbers – began to appear throughout the long Erez corridor along the northern border between Gaza and Israel.\\n\\nIn the unreal silence of the Erez dawn, one can nearly hear the footsteps of those workers, a black plastic bag in their hand with their food from home. All lined up, like legions, hundreds, thousands, waiting to pass through the Israeli military checkpoints at the border. Now there is no one left in this corridor. Even the plastic and cement has disappeared: by 2010, in one of the seemingly never-ending “aesthetic” changes to the Erez crossing, the 200-meter-long corridor has transformed into a path edged by a metal net and a corrugated iron roof. Despite the changes, the silence remains the same.\\n\\nAt Erez, silence is amplified from the other side of the wall that separates Gaza from Israel by the improbably high ceilings of the enormous terminal that lies alone as though it is some kind of exhibition: a beautiful terminal, styled like an airport, and completely empty. As fate would have it, the terminal was completed after the dream of a transborder industrial zone had already been shattered by the failure of the Oslo process, by the Second Intifada, and by terrorism. All that remains of that pained humanity that crossed the border to earn its daily keep are the snapshots taken by photographers for the agencies.\\n\\nNot even the few remaining porters, often little more than boys, can break the stony silence of Erez. Without words, they help the few Palestinians who try to cross: the sick with their applications to be hospitalised beyond the border, the employees of international organisations on missions to Israel, and a few businessmen with special permits. They are the ones who belong to the select few “special categories,” the only Palestinians who have the good fortune of being able to leave Gaza. Ever since the summer of 2005, when the Israeli pullout from the area crystallised the frontier with Israel to the north and west, no one else has been allowed to leave the Strip. The roughly 9,000 settlers who used to live in Gaza – who, thanks to Tel Aviv’s good offices, had established three settlement blocs in the Strip – are no longer there.\\n\\nBefore falling into a coma, then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had made the most momentous political decision since the Israeli pullout from southern Lebanon in 2000 by also withdrawing from Gaza, again unilaterally. Hamas’s electoral victory of January 25, 2006, came a few short months after this unprecedented change, after Sharon had ordered the end of the Israeli presence in the Strip. And it was precisely in Gaza that Hamas had its stronghold.\\n\\nHamas’s strength was one of the most important reasons given for the quarantine under which Israel increasingly placed Gaza until, in June 2007 – in the move that would bring Hamas to power in the Strip – Gaza was completely sealed off from the rest of the world. But even in previous years, the number of Palestinians who could manage to get work permits in Israel had been steadily decreasing to the point of disappearing entirely, while an authorisation to attend a university outside the Strip – whether in Egypt, in the United States, in Jordan, or in Europe – has always been considered a lottery prize, one to be claimed by only a few lucky ones among the thousands who graduate each year.\\n\\nA few others earn their keep working as porters at Erez. They work for years and years, and they wait for ever-fewer customers, most of them severely sick Palestinians who received a permit from the Israeli authorities after passing through a long procedure. The porters help elderly women and mothers with sick children, accepting a few shekels to physically transport them on wrecked luggage trolleys. The porters – who lived through the still-ongoing changes at Erez – greet the few rare guests who arrive from the other side of the wall: VIPs, journalists, nongovernmental organisation (NGO) volunteers, diplomats, spies – all high-risk specialists, the only ones who care about the destiny of a place so distant from the daily life of the rest of the world. From the few experts who still pass through Erez, the young porters hope that apart from some loose change, they’ll get a few cigarettes – one of the most expensive goods in the Strip, under the increasingly strict isolation imposed by the Israeli army and economy.\\n\\nWelcome to Gaza. Welcome to one of the most desperate places on the planet even well before Hamas’s rise to power. The records only half describe Gaza’s predicament: the highest population density in the world, the most consistent demographic increase in the region with over five children per woman, and since the second half of 2008, the unfortunate distinction of the highest unemployment level on the planet.\\n\\nA smack in the face, squarely delivered when the sun, sand, and dust break the desolation of Erez’s long corridor. Off to the right, the empty shells of buildings destroyed by the Israelis for “security reasons” appear, destroyed so that the military’s control might extend a few kilometres in from the wall at Erez, up to the buildings funded by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the old ruler of the Emirates who passed away in November 2004 at virtually the same time as Yasser Arafat.\\n\\nA solitary red flag used to fly here – at least until the end of 2007 – above the ghostly shell of rooms and pillars, atop the steel skeletons of the destroyed buildings of the broken industrial dream that was Erez: neither the green flag of Hamas nor the historical yellow flag of Fatah, but the adventurous banner of the PFLP, the “reds” of the Palestinian political arena, their banner flying and ready to take on the Israeli army’s guns all by themselves. That red flag, borne up by the wind, didn’t last long. Just a few months and it disappeared. And along with it, the last building next to the wall that marked the border, completely flattened in order to allow the Israeli army a perfect view.\\n\\nAll that remains now, immutable, is the rhythm of Erez clicking along. Godot’s silence, the silence of those who wait in fear for something to come along to break the monotony of desolation: tanks entering the olive groves of Beit Hanoun, a Qassam rocket launched toward the towns of the Negev, there, just beyond the border, and the Israeli Air Force’s missiles ready for targeted assassination. Or an entirely different situation, like the massive attack code-named “Hot Winter,” which took place over the space of barely six days between February and March 2008.\\n\\nThe incursion resulted in 130 dead and 350 wounded among Palestinians, as well as two dead Israeli soldiers who had penetrated just over the horizon of Erez under tank and air cover into that selfsame Beit Hanoun of Sheikh Zayed’s buildings, and a little farther down into Jabalia, once a refugee camp and now a populous town. It was said at the time that the operation was a response to the Qassam rockets, and to the more sophisticated Grad, which had been launched toward cities in southern Israel. And the rockets, in turn, were often launched as reprisals for a targeted assassination carried out not just in Gaza, but also in the West Bank, to demonstrate that at least as far as the armed factions were concerned, the two Palestinian entities were still united. A few days’ closure, with hell breaking loose next door. A few days during which that paradoxical silence and everyday routine are broken in a way that only low-intensity conflict can break them.\\n\\nIt is in these moments that Erez changes, if only for a few days, before once again closing that doorway into hell, replacing Charon’s sunken eyes with the tired face of a taxi driver, who drives you to Gaza’s new reality: Hamas’s political and administrative control of the tiny Palestinian strip along the Mediterranean coast. As time passes, Hamas’s power becomes more stable, as can be seen in the thorough, polite yet lengthy check of the visitors done by the newly appointed Islamist government’s bureaucracy at the new gate a few hundred meters from Erez: a few border offices, policemen, and uniformed personnel carrying laptops with webcams to register the newcomer’s name, passport, and face.\\n\\nExcerpted with permission from Hamas: From Resistance to Regime, Paola Caridi, Seven Stories Press.',\n",

The UAE rejected the resolution, while Brazil and Mozambique abstained.\\n\\nThe Russian draft resolution, which was also put to a vote, called for an \"immediate humanitarian ceasefire\" and unequivocally condemns the attacks of Oct. 7 and the \"indiscriminate attacks\" on civilians and civilian targets in Gaza.\\n\\nIn that vote, four countries voted in favor – Russia, China, the UAE, and Gabon. The United States and the UK voted against it, and nine countries abstained.\\n\\nThe resolution wasn\\'t adopted because it failed to get the minimum nine \"yes\" votes.\\n\\nThe failure of the two resolutions followed the council\\'s rejections last week of a Russian resolution that didn\\'t mention Hamas and also failed to get nine \"yes\" votes and a widely supported Brazilian resolution vetoed by the US that would have condemned the Hamas attacks and all violence against civilians and called for \"humanitarian pauses.\"\\n\\nRussia\\'s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia justified the veto by saying that the US draft resolution could be interpreted as the Security Council\\'s support for Israel\\'s plans to start a ground operation in Gaza.\\n\\nNebenzia warned that Israel\\'s prospective forceful operation in Gaza carried out in the current manner and with gross violations of human laws and massive loss of civilian life, risks provoking a larger conflict that could encompass the entire region and even go beyond its borders.\\n\\nWhereas the Chinese delegate Zhang Jun said the US draft resolution was \"out of balance\" and \"deeply divisive\" on the urgent issue of ending the fighting.\\n\\nHe called it \"evasive on the most urgent issue of ending the fighting,\" saying it does not reflect the world\\'s strongest calls for a ceasefire or an end to the fighting and does not help resolve the issue.\\n\\n\"At this moment, ceasefire is not just a diplomatic term. It means the life and death of many civilians.\"\\n\\nAfter the double veto, the US ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the 15-member council that Washington was deeply disappointed that Russia and China vetoed this resolution.\\n\\n\"Though today\\'s vote was a setback, we must not be deterred.\"\\n\\nAlso, US representative Robert Wood said that the \"bad faith resolution\" put forward by Russia lacked consensus and failed to reflect realities on the ground.\\n\\n\"It was regrettable that Moscow chose to further divide the Council rather than address the needs of Israel and Palestine,\" he added.\\n\\nBritish delegate Barbara Woodward said the US draft would have had a tangible impact on the ground by calling for humanitarian pauses and the hostages\\' release.\\n\\nShe added that the British delegation voted against Russia\\'s text as it failed to recognize Israel\\'s right to self-defense.\\n\\nThe deep divisions in the Security Council caused frustration among several diplomats.\\n\\nA diplomat said France tried vainly to persuade Russia and the US to withdraw their texts before referring them to a vote.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the UAE Ambassador, Lana Nusseibeh, said the UN and humanitarian organizations have made clear that what is essential is a humanitarian ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and sustained humanitarian access to Gaza.\\n\\nNusseibeh said there were \"dozens of statements imploring this council to assign the same value to Palestinian life as it does to Israeli life,\" adding: \"We cannot allow any equivocation on this point.\"\\n\\nIn response, Israel\\'s UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan thanked the US and other nations that supported its resolution for condemning \"savage genocidal terrorists while standing up for the values of freedom and security.\"\\n\\nHe denounced those who voted against the resolution, saying they showed the world the Security Council is incapable of condemning \"terrorists and cannot confirm the right to self-defense of the victim of these heinous crimes.\"\\n\\nAfter the failure of the US and Russian drafts, Malta\\'s UN Ambassador Vanessa Frazier, speaking on behalf of the ten elected council members serving two-year terms, announced they would be working on a new proposal in the coming days.\\n\\n\"As elected members of this council, we also represent the rest of the international community, and we have a duty and an obligation to act,\" Frazier told the council. \"There is no time to waste.\"',\n",

His anxiety comes in the wake of ongoing action described by the Yogi Adityanath-led government in Uttar Pradesh as a ‘crackdown’ on those supporting Palestine amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in West Asia.\\n\\nJameel has stopped writing on social media platforms about the Palestine crisis despite having so many thoughts in his mind. He writes and deletes but does not dare to post in support of Palestine out of fear as the UP Chief Minister has directed police to take strict action against anyone attempting to make \"inciteful\" statements either on social media or from places of worship.\\n\\n\"A few years back, we saw a lockdown in the wake of COVID. The government is putting a similar ban on our pens and minds. We cannot write what we see with our own eyes or what we think. We don\\'t feel that we are free citizens of a free country anymore,\" Jameel told NewsClick.\\n\\nRecalling the UP Police crackdown on the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC) in which at least media\\n\\n23 Muslims died across the state, he said, \"One of my friends was arrested and sent to jail for three days for sharing a post of mine on social media condemning CAA and NRC as being against the Indian tradition of inclusiveness and idea of a pluralist democracy.

However, videos coming from Gaza are heart-wrenching. Hundreds of people died in the horrific airstrike by Israel. I wanted to share those videos of how cruel Israel is taking innocent lives, but due to fear of legal action, I am not sharing anything. In fact, I stopped using the internet. Our colleagues are keeping tabs on our social media and what we (Muslims) are writing/sharing on social sites,\" he said.\\n\\nSuhail Ansari, a constable who was posted in the Lakhimpur Kheri district, was suspended, and a departmental enquiry was initiated against him for allegedly sharing posts in support of Palestine. According to the police, he had launched a drive on social media to collect funds to help Palestine.\\n\\nAnsari, a resident of Bareilly, posted on his Facebook account, according to the police.\\n\\n\"Help Save Palestine. I Repost=$1 All Donations Are Directly Sent To... Add To Story To Help Save Palestine,\" the post reads.\\n\\nTalking to media persons, Kheri deputy superintendent of police Sandeep Singh, who is posted as circle officer (city) there, said an additional superintendent of police rank officer was inquiring about the constable and his inclination as well as supportive posts for Palestine on social media.\\n\\nHe said the inquiry was probing all aspects, and stern action could be taken against him if he is found the culprit.\\n\\nHowever, the Ansari family refuted the allegation of collecting funds for Palestine.\\n\\n\"Suhail did not write anything in support of Palestine but shared a forwarded message that sharing posts will credit one dollar to Palestinians. What is crime in this? Everyday people keep sharing forward messages on social media, but no action is taken against them,\" a relative told NewsClick.\\n\\nIn a similar case, the police registered a case against an unidentified youth in Bareilly district who had posted pictures of aerial bombings on Gaza.\\n\\nAdityanath has warned of strict action against anyone indulging in activities that oppose the Indian government\\'s stand on the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict and voicing support for Palestine on social media.\\n\\nThe directive came close on the heels of a \\'pro-Palestine\\' march in support of Palestinians held in Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) campus last week.\\n\\nMeanwhile, several Muslim youths and clerics have been detained for their posts on Palestine.\\n\\nA Muslim cleric was arrested in Uttar Pradesh\\'s Hamirpur for posting content in support of Palestine on social media. The accused has been identified as 23-year-old Suhail Ansari.\\n\\nThe police on Friday booked Ansari and another cleric named Atif Chowdhary under Indian Penal Code Sections 153A (promoting enmity between two groups) and 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) in the case. The police are conducting raids to take Chowdhary into custody.\\n\\nA doctor identified as Parmendra Maheshwari has also been booked in Bareilly for allegedly making objectionable comments against Muslims on WhatsApp after the Israel-Hamas war broke out.\\n\\nMaheshwari has been charged under Indian Penal Code Sections 153A (promoting enmity between two groups) and 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs). He has not been arrested yet.\\n\\nResentment Over Police Crackdown on AMU Students\\n\\nThe Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) campus witnessed uneasy calm as hundreds of security personnel guarded the main gate of the varsity. Throughout the day, the campus streets bore silence, while students completely avoided writing anything related to Palestine.\\n\\nResentment is brewing among students soon after four students were booked for participating in a protest march on the university campus to express solidarity with Palestinians. Aligarh police registered a case at Civil Lines police station against the four students mentioned in the first information report (FIR).\\n\\nOn October 8, approximately 100 students gathered at Duck Point in the AMU campus for the march. They proceeded to march to the main gate or Bab-e-Syed gate of AMU, chanting slogans in support of Palestinians and condemning Israel for its \"dominance and atrocities against civilians\".\\n\\nBoth the university and district administration said that the protest march was held without the required permission for such activities on the university campus.\\n\\nAccording to the FIR (seen by NewsClick), a case has been filed under Sections 153A (promoting enmity among different groups), 188 (disobedience to orders promulgated by a public servant), and Section 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\\n\\nCommenting over the ongoing situation, Sarfraz Nazeer, a lawyer in Siddharthnagar, told NewsClick, \"When the Ministry of External Affairs supported the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine, why is the state government taking action against its citizens? The reason people are afraid of writing on social media is that police first book for post, and then they call for interrogation. In the name of interrogation, they run from police station to court, and nobody wants to run from pillar to post for merely sharing a post on social media.\"',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Leading up to the 2020 election, Arab American organizers in south-east Michigan like Terry Ahwal worked to convince their community to go to the polls for Joe Biden. The message was simple: Donald Trump’s Islamophobic rhetoric and policies such as the Middle East travel ban were a threat to Arab Americans. Voters mobilized to help push Biden over the top in this critical swing state.\\n\\nSeveral years on, amid Biden’s full-throated support of Israel in the current war and an unfolding humanitarian crisis that has claimed thousand of lives in Gaza, Ahwal feels deep regret: “I have to say “I’m sorry’ to my friends.’”\\n\\nAhwal is among hundreds of thousands of Arab Americans in Michigan, many of whom are watching with horror as the US supports Israel as it carries out its bombing campaign. After the community backed Biden by a wide margin in November 2020, the feeling goes “beyond betrayal”, about a dozen Arab Americans in Michigan said.\\n\\n“This is a complete loss of humanity, it is the active support of a genocide, and I don’t think it gets any worse than that,” said Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian American activist and attorney. “I’ve gotten a few comments, ‘Well, the GOP is going to be worse,’ and my question is: ‘How can you get worse than active support of a genocide?’”\\n\\nPolls show that Americans have generally been supportive of Israel and its response to the 7 October attack, though Morning Consult data released this week also shows the number of people who sympathize equally with Israelis and Palestinians is on the rise. That poll also showed support for Biden’s response is growing.\\n\\nBut Arab Americans who spoke with the Guardian said they did not know of anyone in their community who would vote for Biden in 2024. That could have profound consequences in a state in which Trump won by 10,000 votes in 2016, and a tight rematch is taking shape.\\n\\nStill, the Biden administration has remained steadfastly supportive of Israel, proposing $14bn in aid; providing weapons such as missiles and armored personnel carriers; refusing calls for a ceasefire; and deploying US troops to the region. A Data for Progress poll released Thursday found 66% of Americans think the US should call for a ceasefire.\\n\\nThe use of Arab American tax dollars to bomb Gaza is generating “widespread horror and fury”, Arraf said.\\n\\nThough Biden has called on Israel to show restraint and touted a deal he struck to allow trucks carrying aid to enter Gaza, Arab Americans who spoke with the Guardian view the gestures as pittances. They see the US’s support as ham-fisted and “shocking” in the context of the last presidential election.\\n\\n“Even our conservative members voted for Biden, only to get a guy who dehumanizes us, who is sending the weapons to Israel, and the only purpose of these weapons is to use Palestinian as target practice,” Ahwal said. “I don’t know anybody who would vote for him.”\\n\\nThat sentiment was echoed by Muslim and Arab Americans elsewhere in the country. Zohran Mamdani, a New York assemblymember, called Biden’s response to the crisis “disgusting” and warned that the president is underestimating the Arab American voting bloc.\\n\\n“I have had many constituents of mine, as well as Muslims from beyond my district, reach out to me and ask me: ‘How am I supposed to vote for Joe Biden?’ And I don’t know what I’m supposed to tell them,” he said.\\n\\nA number of people also expressed fears that the Biden administration’s rhetoric and positions are fanning the flames of Islamophobia in the US and putting their communities in danger. People who are publicly critical of Israel or supportive of Palestine have lost jobs and faced harassment in recent weeks. Muslim and Arab American politicians are receiving death threats and the level of vitriol is above what was experienced in the wake of 9/11, said Abraham Aiyash, a Muslim American state representative in Michigan.\\n\\nThe president’s comparison of Hamas’s attacks to “15 9/11s”, Aiyash said, “enhances Islamophobia”, referencing the recent murder in Illinois of a six-year-old Palestinian American boy in an alleged hate crime.\\n\\n“If you support [Israel’s war] abroad, you have to be ready for the consequences of it at home,” he said.\\n\\nA demonstration in Dearborn, Michigan. The critical swing state is home to 300,000 Arab Americans who helped boost Biden after Clinton’s narrow 2016 loss. Photograph: Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images\\n\\nMultiple Palestinian Americans who do not work in politics declined to speak with the Guardian over safety fears.\\n\\nAny potential for political fallout for Biden is greatest in Michigan, a critical swing state that is home to 300,000 Arab Americans who helped boost Biden after Clinton’s narrow 2016 loss. Biden beat Trump in 2020 by about 150,000 votes.\\n\\nFew – if any – issues are more important to this group than Palestine and Middle East foreign policy, said Amer Zahr, a Palestinian American activist and comedian. He noted that Dearborn, a majority Arab American city just outside Detroit, went for Bernie Sanders by a significant margin during the last two Democratic presidential primaries because Sanders was willing to challenge US policy on Israel.\\n\\nBut Biden was viewed as better than Trump, so Arab-Americans turned out in the general election, Zahr said. Next time, many people have said, they will vote third party, or leave the top of the ticket blank.\\n\\nDearborn went 63% for Clinton in 2016 when she lost the state by 10,000 votes, but nearly 80% for Biden four years later. In the four municipalities with the largest Arab American populations in metro Detroit, about 40,000 more people voted for Biden than Clinton.\\n\\n“They came into our community and asked us to vote for Joe Biden and save America from Donald Trump, and now we feel like we have to save Palestine from Joe Biden,” Zahr added. “The argument that we heard before is we have to save the country from Trump – that’s not going to work.”\\n\\n“If [2024] is going to be a close election then the loss of Arab American support for Biden could have an impact,” said the state pollster Bernie Porn.\\n\\nThe White House’s “lazy” language and the skewed portrayal of the crisis in US media dehumanizes Arabs – Palestinians, in particular, said James Zogby, the founder and president of the Arab American Institute, a Washington DC-based civil rights advocacy organization.\\n\\n“This objectification of Palestinians and the humanization of Israelis – which is an old story going back to the beginning of the conflict – fed into the pre-existing narrative that it’s Israeli people versus the Arab or Palestinian problem,” he said.\\n\\nThe White House, he added, “sets the tone”, and “it’s important for us to let the administration know, you’re at risk of losing this particular component group of the community.”\\n\\nThose who spoke with the Guardian said they found the situation especially frustrating because they expected this kind of policy and positions from Republicans, but not Democrats.\\n\\n“What makes me incensed with Democrats is that they preach human rights, preach equality and diversity, but when it comes to Palestinians, all the preaching goes away, and there is justification for the killing and slaughter,” Ahwal said.\\n\\n“I know the ramifications and I know the consequences but I cannot justify a vote for a guy who says it’s OK to kill Palestinians.”',\n",

We don\\'t want escalation,” Mr. Blinken said. \"We don\\'t want to see our forces or our personnel come under fire. But if that happens, we\\'re ready for it.”\\n\\nMr. Austin, echoing Mr. Blinken, said “what we’re seeing is a prospect of a significant escalation of attacks on our troops and our people throughout the region.”\\n\\nIsrael-Hamas war, Day 17 LIVE updates\\n\\nHe said the U.S. has the right to self-defence “and we won\\'t hesitate to take the appropriate action.”\\n\\nThe warning from the high-ranking U.S. officials came as Israel\\'s military response to a deadly October 7 attack by Hamas on civilians in communities in southern Israel entered its third week.\\n\\nIsraeli warplanes struck targets across Gaza overnight and into Sunday, as well as two airports in Syria and a mosque in the occupied West Bank allegedly used by militants as the war threatened to engulf more of the Middle East.\\n\\nIsrael has traded fire with Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group on a near-daily basis since the war began, and tensions are soaring in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces have battled militants in refugee camps and carried out two airstrikes in recent days.\\n\\nThe U.S. announced Sunday that non-essential staff at its embassy in Iraq should leave the country.\\n\\nMr. Blinken, who recently spent several days in the region, spoke of a “likelihood of escalation” while saying no one wants to see a second or third front to the hostilities between Israel and Hamas, which rules Gaza.\\n\\nThe secretary said he expects “escalation by Iranian proxies directed against our forces, directed against our personnel,” and added: “We are taking steps to make sure that we can effectively defend our people and respond decisively if we need to.” Iran is an enemy of Israel.\\n\\nMr. Blinken, appearing on NBC\\'s “Meet the Press,” noted that additional military assets had been deployed to the region, including two aircraft carrier battle groups, “not to provoke, but to deter, to make clear that if anyone tries to do anything, we\\'re there.”\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden, repeatedly has used one word to warn Israel’s enemies against trying to take advantage of the situation: “Don’t.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, trucks loaded with food, water and other supplies that Palestinians living in Gaza desperately need continued to enter the enclave on Sunday after a key crossing at the border with Egypt was opened a day earlier to allow humanitarian assistance to begin flowing.\\n\\nBut Cindy McCain, executive director of the U.N. World Food Program, said the situation in Gaza remained “catastrophic.\" She said even more aid needs to be allowed in.\\n\\nShe said her organisation was able to feed 200,000 people dinner on Saturday “but that\\'s not enough.

       " {'articleBody': \"The Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) is an industry body and hence stakeholders must themselves come up with a solution, reiterated Information and Broadcasting Secretary Apurva Chandra during an exclusive conversation with exchange4media in his Delhi office.\\n\\nHe also stressed that the government has no intention of regulating the content on OTT platforms or streaming services. In the interview with Kanchan Srivastava, Chandra also shared the government’s plans for the media and entertainment sector.\\n\\nExcerpts:\\n\\nThere were speculations that the government may put a stay on TRPs of news channels before the elections if they continue to show provocative content. Any comments?\\n\\nAs of now, there is no such plan. BARC has started sharing Raw Level Data (RLD) with channels now. Earlier, the news channels complained about the lack of data and transparency. The objective is to bring transparency and allow channels to track wrong algorithms or manipulation, if any, and then BARC can correct it. The complaint now is that the data is voluminous and can’t be interpreted. They have to try to make sense of it.\\n\\nAre you satisfied with the functioning of BARC?\\n\\nIndia is a diverse country with so many languages, and rural-urban and economic divides. There are just 55,000 panel homes but only a part of the population consumes news. Hence, the margin of error is big.\\n\\nWe don’t receive complaints from the General Entertainment Channels (GECs), which are the largest chunk, in terms of revenue. The issues are largely raised by news channels.\\n\\nWhat could be the reasons behind their complaints against BARC measurement?\\n\\nThere are 55,000 panel homes. Among them, the households that consume news may be 5,000-7,000 with English news consumption further limited to around 500 homes. Even a small error that creeps in, can be multiplied and magnified due to such a small sample size.\\n\\nWhat is the way out? Does MIB have any plans to intervene in the matter?\\n\\nNews channels themselves are divided on this matter. Some have a particular view about it, others have entirely different opinions. There is no unanimity among news channels.\\n\\nBARC is an industry-led body; both broadcasters and advertisers are part of it. The government has no role to play here. The council has to manage on its own.\\n\\nAs per MIB’s latest statistical handbook that you released a few weeks ago, television’s revenue growth has slowed down in FY22. It would be one of the slowest-growing mediums in the next two years at 3.9%, as per projections. Are you concerned about it?\\n\\nTV revenue is not growing at the pace it grew before. Nevertheless, it is still growing. Advertising is growing more on the digital side, but it doesn't mean that TV revenue is not growing. Content creation on the news side continues to grow on TV.\\n\\nIndia has a lot of potential and people are watching both TV and OTT. Historically, some sectors go up, some go down. To retain the interest of people, even GECs are innovating with content and have come up with reality shows.\\n\\nHow many new TV channel applications have you received so far this year? As per MIB data, only 7 new channels were launched in FY23, while 20 were shut down in the two years before that.\\n\\nI don’t have the exact numbers. Applications keep coming. Besides, we have come out with new guidelines that include increasing the minimum net worth requirement to open a news and current affairs channel from Rs 2 crore to Rs 20 crore. For non-news channels, it was hiked to Rs 5 crore. The net worth cap was never revised after 2004.\\n\\nDon’t you think it may impact the government’s revenue as well?\\n\\nWe feel only serious players should be there. There are over 350 news channels in the country, and the number of satellite channels is about 950. But how many channels can you name?\\n\\nThe Indian Broadcasters and Digital Foundation (IBDF) has requested TRAI to deregulate the broadcasting sector and remove the price cap, which faces a dwindling paid subscriber count and competition from DD Free Dish and OTT platforms. What is the MIB’s stand on this?\\n\\nTRAI is a regulator and has to look after the interests of both subscribers and broadcasters. It has taken a view of the scenario. TRAI modifies regulations every two years. NTO 1 (New Tariff Order) and NTO 2.0 were implemented earlier and now NTO 3.0 is being implemented effectively. There is no issue from the customer’s side and not much from the broadcasters’ side as well.\\n\\nAre some directives likely on the cards for the news broadcasting ad industry ahead of the elections?\\n\\nWhy should we issue any directive on elections? For us, the only issue is fake news. News channels are supposed to follow the code of conduct all the time. As long as people conform to the code of conduct, no new directive is required.\\n\\nHowever, many news channels are still being accused of running fake news, with regards to the Israel and Palestine war as the latest example.\\n\\nIt's a matter of taking action. The code of conduct is a robust system. Over the past year, we have blocked 200 news channels for peddling fake news and disinformation. Many of them were YouTube channels with crores of subscribers. Some of them were Pakistan-based, and some were based in Canada, run by Khalistan supporters.\\n\\nIt's been more than a year since the big four broadcasters pulled out their FTA channels from DD Free Dish. How has it impacted DD Free Dish revenue?\\n\\nOn the contrary, DD Free Dish revenue has gone up to Rs 1,050 crore, 30-40 per cent more compared to the previous year when it was Rs 750 crore. News channels on Free Dish are giving more revenue this year.\\n\\nAt the time when things are going digital, what lies ahead for DD in the future? When will DD launch its own OTT platform?\\n\\nWe are working on a plan to develop an OTT platform. DD and AIR have a lot of archival material, which nobody else has. Until the 90s, there were no private channels. Speeches, discussions, interviews, performances of iconic artists like M S Subulakshmi, Bhim Sen Joshi and Bade Ghulam Ali and TV serials are lying in our archives.\\n\\nNow, people want to consume everything on OTT because it's so convenient. Although a lot of our content is available on YouTube, but its cataloguing makes it difficult for people to search. If we have our OTT channel, people will easily access our rich content.\\n\\nWill DD’s OTT be free for viewing? Will it be launched before the elections?\\n\\nPrasar Bharti is still working on that. It is likely to be launched next year. There may be a small subscription fee but things are yet to be worked out.\\n\\nThe ministry had issued a directive to all TV channels early this year to air nationalistic interest programmes for at least 30 minutes every day. How many channels abide by the directive?\\n\\nWe did tell them to air some national interest programmes. However, it is the news channels that largely carry public interest programmes. GECs also carry several programs on social issues.\",\n",

Questions about the extent of Iran\\'s involvement in Hamas\\' Oct. 7 attack on Israel have shone a spotlight on Iranian influence in the Middle East and raised major concerns about the prospect of a wider war engulfing the region.\\n\\nThe U.S. has said there is no direct evidence that Iran was involved in the Hamas attack against Israel. However, analysts and regional experts say there areevident links between Iran and the attacks carried out by Hamas.\\n\\n\"Hamas and Iran have a long-standing but not always easy relationship,\" says Kim Ghattas, author of Black Wave, a book about the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. \"Hamas gets funding and weapons from Iran. So whether or not it approved of the Oct. 7 attack, Iran is complicit.\"\\n\\nAli Barakeh, a senior Hamas official based in Lebanon, told NPR earlier this month that while \"Iran knows that Hamas fights Israel and offers us support, which we do not deny ... we don\\'t take orders from anyone.\"\\n\\nWhat is the link between Iran and Hamas?\\n\\nHamas, a Sunni Islamist movement, is an autonomous Palestinian group with military and political wings. Hamas has ruled more than 2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip since 2007. Gaza has not had elections since Hamas seized power that same year from the Palestinian Authority, which rules the West Bank.\\n\\nHamas receives funding and weapons from Iran. The two have had rifts in the past, and do not always agree. Most recently, they fell out over Syria\\'s civil war. Tehran withdrew funding from Hamas when the group chose to stand with protesters against Syria\\'s leader Bashar Assad, whom Tehran supports. Hamas also has other backers, including Turkey.\\n\\n/ Mahmud Hams/AFP via Getty Images) / Mahmud Hams/AFP via Getty Images) Palestinian fighters of the al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of the Hamas movement, march in a military parade to mark the anniversary of the 2014 war with Israel, near the border in the central Gaza Strip on July 19, 2023.\\n\\nWhat is the \"axis of resistance\"?\\n\\nHamas comes under the so-called \"axis of resistance,\" a multi-pronged network of different forces across the region, supported to varying degrees by Iran.\\n\\nThe term \"axis of resistance\" is believed to have emerged in response to President George W. Bush\\'s use of the term \"axis of evil\" — referring to Iran, Iraq and North Korea — in his 2002 State of the Union address.

Hezbollah wields significant power, especially in southern Lebanon, and is active along Israel\\'s northern border, where tensions have been building since the Oct. 7 attacks.\\n\\nEach axis group has a different relationship with Iran.

       " {'articleBody': 'CNN —\\n\\nThe United States intended to send a strong message to Iran with strikes against pro-Tehran militia groups in Syria that had targeted American troops – while seeking to avoid a dangerous regional escalation amid Israel’s war with Hamas.\\n\\nBy targeting an ammunition and storage area on Thursday night US time, Washington sought to make clear that recent drone and rocket attacks that caused minor injuries to 21 US soldiers in Iraq and Syria will not go unanswered.\\n\\nBut the action is also risky because of soaring tensions as Israel pounds Gaza after October 7 terror attacks against Israeli civilians launched by Hamas – another Iran-allied group. That conflict has provoked fears of a regional war that could draw in Iran, Lebanon and other proxy groups.\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden’s show of strength could set off its own cycle of consequences that could rock a region already on edge. While the US is underscoring that the strikes have nothing to do with the confrontation between Israel and Hamas, such distinctions may be blurred in Arab nations, where public fury is mounting over the deaths of Palestinian civilians in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.\\n\\nThe US actions, which were “narrowly tailored in self-defense,” targeted two facilities linked to Iranian-backed militias in eastern Syria, according to a statement from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The statement said the facilities have been used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and affiliated groups.\\n\\n“Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces. We will not let them,” Austin said.\\n\\nBiden’s political flank\\n\\nBiden has been under domestic political pressure to take a stand against Iranian proxies. Realistically, there was no option but to respond to an attack in which American soldiers were injured.\\n\\nStill, the limited scale of the move is unlikely to placate Biden’s domestic critics, who have long accused him of being soft on Iran. Such criticism ratcheted up after the administration secured the freedom of five prisoners held by Iran last month in return for the transfer of $6 billion in frozen Iranian funds. The administration says the funds can only be used to buy humanitarian supplies but that has not spared Biden from Republican attacks over Hamas’ attack on Israel earlier this month.\\n\\nThe US airstrikes are also certain to, at the very least, heighten the rhetorical tensions between the US and Iran, which are already at alarming levels.\\n\\nIranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, for instance, warned the US that if Israel’s military operation against Hamas in Gaza following the group’s terror attacks doesn’t end, the United States will “not be spared from this fire.”\\n\\nThe US strikes came a day after Biden put Iran on notice about the activities of its militia during a press conference with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\\n\\nAnd Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday warned that while the US doesn’t seek conflict with Iran, it would act swiftly and decisively to respond to attacks by Iran or its proxies in the region.\\n\\nUS begins Middle East build-up\\n\\nEver since Israel started to respond to the Hamas attacks, there have been concerns in Washington that US interests in the region could be threatened.\\n\\nMultiple US officials have told CNN that the US has intelligence that Iranian-backed militia groups are planning to ramp up attacks against American forces in the Middle East as Iran seeks to capitalize on the backlash in the region to US support for Israel.\\n\\nThe airstrikes followed another sign that the US, which has been seeking to disengage from the Middle East, is being drawn back into the region because of the danger to its ally Israel. The Pentagon announced earlier in the day that roughly 900 troops have been deployed or are deploying to the Middle East after a series of attacks on coalition bases that resulted in minor injuries for almost two dozen troops.\\n\\nBiden had previously ordered the deployment of two aircraft carrier groups to the eastern Mediterranean in a show of deterrence to enemies of the US and Israel in the region.\\n\\nPentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that between October 17 and 26, US and coalition forces were attacked “at least 12 separate times in Iraq, four separate times in Syria, by a mix of one-way attack drones and rockets.”\\n\\nSome 21 US service members have received minor injuries as a result of attacks between October 17 and 18, CNN has reported. Of those, 19 have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, Ryder said – 15 at al-Asad Air Base in Iraq, and four at al-Tanf Garrison in Syria.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Russia\\'s parliament has passed the last stage of a law to withdraw Moscow\\'s ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which now goes to President Vladimir Putin for signing. Here is a look at some questions that raises.\\n\\nWhat is the CTBT?\\n\\nThe CTBT, agreed in 1996, bans \"any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion\" anywhere in the world, with the goal of reducing and ultimately eliminating nuclear weapons. Its preamble says it is aimed at supporting disarmament and non-proliferation by constraining the development of nuclear weapons and stopping countries producing more advanced ones.\\n\\nWhich countries have signed and ratified?\\n\\nA total of 187 states have signed the treaty, and 178 have ratified it in their parliaments.\\n\\nOf the nine countries that possess nuclear weapons:\\n\\n- Britain and France have signed and ratified.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n- The United States, Israel and China have signed but not ratified. Russia signed and ratified but is now withdrawing ratification, saying it is \"mirroring\" the U.S. position.\\n\\nIndia, Pakistan and North Korea have yet to sign or ratify.\\n\\nWhat is the legal status of the treaty?\\n\\nThe treaty is not legally valid until 44 named countries sign and ratify it - all nine that have nuclear weapons, and 35 others that possess nuclear power and research reactors.\\n\\nDoes it have any practical effect then?\\n\\nYes, in practice the treaty has created a taboo against explosive nuclear tests. No country has carried such a test since the 1990s except North Korea, which conducted the most recent of its six tests in 2017.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe treaty established a global network of observation posts that can detect the sound, shockwaves or radioactive fallout from a nuclear explosion. When complete, it will comprise 321 monitoring stations and 16 laboratories, hosted by 89 countries. Around 90% are already operational, including in Russia and the United States.\\n\\nWhat Does the Russian Shift Mean?\\n\\nRussia says it is not planning to conduct a test, and will not do so unless the U.S. does. But some analysts see a Russian test as more likely now. Putin has issued what the West sees as nuclear threats since the start of the Ukraine war and may be keeping testing in reserve in case Russia\\'s fortunes decline sharply, when he could use it to warn the West to back off. Publicly, he has not said if he thinks a test is needed or not.\\n\\nWhat Would a Nuclear Test Achieve?\\n\\nNot much in scientific terms, experts say, because full-scale detonations can be accurately simulated using \"subcritical\" tests without a nuclear chain reaction.\\n\\nBoth Russia and the United States have advanced research programs to understand weapon performance and behaviours, said Dylan Spaulding, senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists: \"That kind of research doesn\\'t require full-scale testing, it requires computer modelling.\"',\n",

There was no official announcement by Hamas.\\n\\nIn the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, an air strike killed the pregnant wife of a Palestinian lawyer, Jehad Al-Kafarnah.\\n\\n“My life, my heart, I love you,” Kafarnah wrote, weeping, on the white sheeting wrapped around his wife’s body.

General Assembly in New York on Friday.\\n\\nUnlike in the U.N. Security Council, where resolutions on getting aid to Gaza failed this week, no country will be able to veto the resolution submitted by Arab states calling for a ceasefire, which will not be binding but carry political weight.\\n\\nThe United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, says more than 600,000 Gazans have been made homeless by Israeli bombardment, at least three times more than its shelters can hold.\\n\\nTen more trucks food and medical supplies arrived in the enclave, along with 10 foreign doctors, on Friday, the first to enter since Israel tightened its blockade on Gaza nearly three weeks ago, a Palestinian official at Gaza’s Rafah border crossing with Egypt said.\\n\\nA U.N. official said earlier that around 74 trucks had crossed since the start of the conflict, making some 84 altogether. The U.N. says Gaza needs around 100 trucks every day to meet essential needs and the official said negotiations were taking place with Israel, which wants to prevent resources reaching Hamas, to find a faster mechanism.\\n\\nUS strikes Syrian bases used by Iranian proxies\\n\\nCalls for restraint have been driven not only by concern for Gaza’s civilians and Israeli hostages, but also by fears that the crisis could ignite conflict across the Middle East.\\n\\nU.S. President Joe Biden ordered overnight strikes on two Syrian facilities used by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps and militias that it backs, the Pentagon said. He earlier issued a rare direct warning to Iran on Thursday against targeting U.S. troops in the Middle East.\\n\\nU.S. and coalition troops have been attacked at least 19 times in Iraq and in Syria by Iranian-backed forces in the past week.\\n\\nThe United States has sent warships and fighter aircraft to the region over the last three weeks and on Thursday the Pentagon said about 900 more U.S. troops were en route or in the Middle East to bolster air defences for U.S. personnel.\\n\\nIsrael says Hamas killed some 1,400 people including children in its Oct. 7 rampage.\\n\\nThe Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry said on Thursday that 7,028 Palestinians had been killed in the retaliatory air strikes, including 2,913 children. Reuters could not independently verify the tolls.\\n\\nA poll published in the Israeli daily Maariv newspaper found that 49% said “it would be better to wait” before beginning a large-scale ground offensive, while 29% disagreed.

He has vigorously supported former President Donald Trump\\'s attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As a former constitutional lawyer, he signed an amicus brief in a case aimed at invalidating Pennsylvania\\'s election results and encouraged Trump to \"keep fighting.\"\\n\\nJohnson opposes same-sex marriage and introduced a bill in 2022 that sought to prohibit schools from discussing gender identity with children under 10, a move critics likened to Florida\\'s \"Don\\'t Say Gay\" law.\\n\\nHe is a staunch opponent of abortion rights, celebrating the Supreme Court\\'s decision to overturn Roe v.

       " {'articleBody': '“Stop the bombs and save lives!” the Palestinian ambassador pleaded at an emotional UN meeting on Thursday on the war in Gaza. But Israel’s envoy was adamant, declaring again, “We will not rest until Hamas is obliterated”.\\n\\nThe war sparked by Gaza’s Hamas rulers’ surprise attacks on Israel on October 7 played out in the vast hall of the 193-nation General Assembly, where Arab nations expected to adopt a resolution on Friday calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza after the Security Council’s four failed attempts to agree on any action.\\n\\nAt the assembly’s resumed emergency special session on Israeli actions in the Palestinian territories on Thursday, speaker after speaker backed the Arab resolution’s cease-fire call — except for Israel’s UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan, who told the 193-member world body, “A cease-fire means giving Hamas time to rearm itself, so they can massacre us again.”\\n\\nAlso Read Pak election commission rules out any delay in polls after President Alvi casts doubt\\n\\nAfter quoting several Hamas statements vowing to destroy Israel and the Jews, he said, “Any call for a cease-fire is not an attempt at peace. It is an attempt to tie Israel’s hands, preventing us from eliminating a huge threat to our citizens.” But the calls for a cease-fire, the protection of Palestinian civilians facing constant Israeli bombardments in Gaza and the delivery of desperately needed food, water, medicine and fuel were often passionate and intense from nearly a dozen countries that spoke Thursday.\\n\\nWhile the Hamas attacks killed some 1,400 Israelis, more than 7,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\\n\\nOn another key issue — the more than 220 hostages taken from Israel — Iran’s foreign minister said Hamas is ready to release civilian prisoners, and he said the international community must take responsibility for releasing 6,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.\\n\\nIran “stands ready to play its part in this very important humanitarian endeavour, along with Qatar and Turkiye”, Hossein Amirabdollahian told the assembly.\\n\\nIran is a key backer of Hamas and Qatar has already played a key role in the release of four Israeli civilians.\\n\\nIsrael’s Erdan said the country’s action has nothing to do with the Arab-Israeli conflict or the Palestinian question. “This is not a war with the Palestinians. Israel is at war with the genocidal Jihadist Hamas terror organisation,” he said.\\n\\nBut Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian UN ambassador, said 70 per cent of those killed in Gaza were children and women. “Is this the war some of you are defending? Can this war be defended? These are crimes. This is barbarism,” he said. “If you do not stop it for all those who were killed, stop it for all those whose lives we can still save,” he said.\\n\\nThe anguish over the deaths on both sides was palpable. Mansour’s voice cracked when he spoke of a Palestinian girl killed before the birthday her father had planned and a man hugging the body of his dead mother and saying: “Come back, and I will take you wherever you want.” Erdan’s voice rose when he told the assembly of Hamas fighters firing blindly at hundreds of young people at a concert in southern Israel, parading naked girls that they had raped, and crushing the skulls of babies.\\n\\nHe showed a brief video of a badly injured agricultural worker from Thailand being decapitated “with a blunt gardening tool”. Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, speaking on behalf of the 22-nation Arab Group, spoke emotionally of children dying under the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli precision bombs, and some still alive and trapped with no equipment to pull them out.\\n\\n“The parents can still hear them. They talk to them helplessly, knowing that they are running out of air and are slowly dying,” he said. In a sharp rebuke to the Israeli ambassador, he told the assembly, “I don’t have videos to show you. We respect the dead too much. We respect the pain of their families too much to show videos.” Safadi also criticised Erdan for not saying a word “about Palestinian lives shattered in this war”.\\n\\n“Don’t let them tell you this is a war between Muslims and Jews,” he said. “We value life, Muslim life, Christian life, Jewish life.” He was interrupted with applause when he then said, “We care about all lives. … Don’t let them tell you otherwise.” The Jordanian minister also told Israel that it cannot remain above international law requiring protection of civilians, hospitals, schools, homes and other infrastructure.\\n\\n“The right to self-defence is not a license to kill with impunity,” he stressed. Safadi also criticised the United States and its allies without naming them. “Many among us believe that they are helping Israel by supporting its war,” he said. “They are not. Instead of sending weapons to Israel, send delegations to open an immediate and viable path to peace. This is how they can help Israel.”\\n\\nIran’s Amirabdollahian accused the United States of directly participating in the war and what he called a “genocide” against the Palestinians. “The genocide in Gaza must stop immediately,” he said. He warned against “the uncontrollable consequences of the unlimited financial, arms and operational support by the White House to the Tel Aviv regime” which has added to the severe bombardments and killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.\\n\\nAlso Read US strikes Iran-linked sites in Syria in retaliation for attacks on US troops\\n\\nThe emergency General Assembly meeting resumes Friday morning, with about 100 speakers remaining. The resolution that Mansour said will be put to a vote on Friday afternoon calls for an immediate cease-fire and demands that all parties respect international law and protect civilians.\\n\\nIt says that essential goods including food, water and medicine should be provided in the Gaza Strip. It also calls for Israel to rescind its order for Gazans to move from the north to the south, for maximum restraint and for the release of all civilians.\\n\\nUnlike the Security Council, there are no vetoes in the General Assembly and its resolutions are not legally binding. But they do reflect world opinion and the size of the vote in favour will be closely watched.\\n\\nThe Palestinians have wide support, but Israel’s Erdan called the resolution “a disgrace” for not even mentioning Hamas and urged countries to oppose it.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Eylon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson, has said that military action inside the Gaza strip will happen at the \"time of our choosing\" and focus of his country is to \"totally destroy the military and governing capabilities\" of Hamas.\\n\\nThe terror attack by Hamas on October 7 shocked the West Asian country and the world, during which 1400 Israelis were killed and over 200 taken as hostages.\\n\\nSpeaking to WION’s diplomatic correspondent Sidhant Sibal, Levy said, \"We are going to destroy Hamas, we are going to enter the Gaza Strip and totally demolish the entirety of its military terrorist and governing structure inside the Gaza Strip.\"\\n\\nSince the attacks, Israel increased its air strikes in Gaza to deal with Hamas hideouts, but this has led to a humanitarian crisis as well.\\n\\nThe spokesperson explained, \" Israel isn\\'t targeting civilians, we are targeting Hamas. That\\'s why we are asking civilians inside the Gaza Strip to step out of the way, out of the areas that are going to see very heavy fighting because we don\\'t want them to get hurt as we proceed with our campaign to destroy Hamas\\'s terror infrastructure\".\\n\\nHere’s the full interview:\\n\\nWION: Will there be a ground offensive in Gaza, particularly northern Gaza in the next few days?\\n\\nEylon Levy: Israel remains united around one goal, victory, total victory against Hamas. Our goal is to totally destroy the military and governing capabilities of the brutal terror organization that perpetrated the October 7 massacre. This is the worst terrorist attack in world history since 9/11. Around 1400 Israelis were murdered, Hamas death squads went door-to-door and beheaded babies, burning whole families alive, committing brutal acts of rape, tying parents and children together and setting them on fire, mutilating them, torturing them before their deaths. About 5,000 people have been injured.\\n\\nThere are now more than 220 Israeli hostages , some babies as young as a few months old in captivity, hostages inside the Gaza Strip and we\\'ve decided in response to that, that we are going to totally defeat Hamas. Now Israel is going to use its force carefully and judiciously, we will act and proceed with the ground offensive at a time of our choosing , when it is right for our operational needs. But the world needs to understand that the situation now is different. The road ahead is going to be long. It is going to be difficult, but Hamas declared war on us on the seventh of October with that brutal attack against our people and we have no choice now but to win that war. And that war will end with the total defeat of Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\\n\\nWION: The Israeli president claimed that Hamas used cyanide. Can you elaborate?\\n\\nEylon Levy: President Isaac Herzog said that Hamas fighters had in fact been carrying on their bodies instruction manuals from al-Qaeda, the terror organisation behind 911, showing that they had information in order to build cyanide, use chemical weapons against our people. This shows the connection between Hamas, al Qaeda and ISIS, and shows exactly why it\\'s in the same league as the terror organisations all around the world who commit horrific crimes against humanity that they have perpetrated.\\n\\nThis is why we are going after Hamas with an intent to destroy it, not to deter it, not to degrade it, to destroy it, because Hamas has revealed itself as the face of sheer, pure , unadulterated evil that would do by the way, exactly the same as it did on October the seventh if given half a chance and murder as many people inside Israel as it could by burning them, by beheading them, using chemical weapons if it could, and that is why we are going to continue with our campaign to destroy Hamas.\\n\\nAnd, we appreciate all the international support and solidarity that we\\'ve been receiving, including from the people of India, all around the world, people understanding that Israel not only has a right, it has a duty to defend itself against these barbarians, these terrorists in the wake of these atrocious, atrocious crimes against humanity.\\n\\nWION: While Israel has been acting against Hamas, there has been a humanitarian challenge in Gaza. You have asked the people to move towards the south. So, what do you have to say about the humanitarian and the collateral loss which is happening in Gaza?\\n\\nEylon Levy: First and foremost, I would say that the humanitarian question is on the minds of Israelis around the country, and so is the fate and condition of the more than 220 Israeli hostages, inside the Gaza Strip. We\\'re talking about babies some a few months old. Elderly people over the age of 80 without medication being kept in a brutal tunnel somewhere by a terrorist organization that tortured, murdered their families in Israel, not given access to the Red Cross.\\n\\nNow it\\'s the humanitarian question that is concerning everyone in Israel. But as for the civilians in Gaza, it\\'s important to say Israel isn\\'t targeting civilians, we are targeting Hamas. That\\'s why we are asking civilians inside the Gaza Strip to step out of the way, out of the areas that are going to see very heavy fighting because we don\\'t want them to get hurt as we proceed with our campaign to destroy Hamas\\'s terror infrastructure.\\n\\nNow, we\\'ve all been watching the same images on TV, the images coming out of the Gaza Strip are very difficult to watch. And I think the world is right to be outraged. But that outrage needs to be directed at the brutal terrorist organization that has subjugated the people of Gaza for the last 16 years subordinating them to its terrorist regime. It should be directed at the terror organization that has consistently stolen humanitarian aid , the terror organization that has embedded itself among civilian areas, under people\\'s homes, under schools, under hospitals and the terror organization that is physically preventing people from escaping and as much as Israel is trying to do everything we\\'re trying to do to keep civilians safe inside the Gaza Strip. By the way, Israel has also evacuated over 100,000 of our own people away from areas of combat because we don\\'t want them to be hurt, but it\\'s important to understand everything that happens inside the Gaza Strip. Any human suffering that happens there is solely and squarely the responsibility and fault of Hamas, the evil terrorist organization that perpetrated the October 7 massacre.\\n\\nWION: Do you think that the situation is getting worse in the northern border? Do you expect Hezbollah to open another front which can be a worrisome factor for Israel?\\n\\nEylon Levy: Israel is not interested in a war on two fronts, despite Hezbollah\\'s efforts to escalate the situation in the north and step up its attacks against our people, our forces under the direction and guidance of Iran. Israel does not want to fight on two fronts. We are focusing at the moment on destroying Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to the October 7 massacre. But it\\'s important to understand that Israel is ready to fight that war. We are ready to defend our people and we will win that war. We hold the state of Lebanon responsible and accountable for any attacks emanating from its territory and as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the consequences for Lebanon will indeed be severe. If Hezbollah drags us into a full-scale war, we don\\'t want that to happen, but if they do, we\\'re ready to fight. We\\'re ready to defend our people and we\\'re ready to win.\\n\\nWION: As you mentioned the hostage situation is a concerning situation as many of them are foreign nationals as well. What do you expect, any positive glimmer of hope? We saw two American hostages being released. So, when it comes to the fate of other hostages, what kind of conversations are happening?\\n\\nEylon Levy: First of all, we of course welcomed the release of the two hostages. There are now more than another 220 and we expect more international pressure to secure their release as well. Our demand is clear and unequivocal. We demand the immediate and unconditional release of every single one of those hostages, we demand that In the meanwhile, they be given access to the International Red Cross. That\\'s a basic humanitarian condition. We want them back and Israel is going to do everything necessary in order to bring back our hostages from those babies to the elderly people and make sure that they are brought back to the loving embrace of their families because there is no excuse, there is absolutely zero excuse for ripping a baby, shooting its parents and taking it into captivity inside the Gaza Strip. No excuse in the whole world must be absolutely clear that what Hamas did was a war crime, that it\\'s unforgivable. And we need our people back.\\n\\nWION: You talked about the ground offensive. Does that option remain on the table because there\\'s a lot of anger in Israel over the terror attack by Hamas. So, is this an option that will be eventually exercised by the Israeli government?\\n\\nEylon Levy: The next stage in the campaign to destroy Hamas. I\\'m not going to speculate live on TV exactly when that will happen. But it will happen in accordance with our operational needs. Because the October 7 massacre showed us that we as a country simply can no longer live beside an ISIS style terror organisation. We can no longer leave it with the abilities to perpetrate such a massacre. Again, we will not accept a quick fix.\\n\\nThat takes us back to the situation at 6am on the morning of October 7. We are going to destroy Hamas, we are going to enter the Gaza Strip and totally demolish the entirety of its military terrorist and governing structure inside the Gaza Strip. We\\'re going for complete victory and we\\'re going to use our force carefully and judiciously as we pursue that goal.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'With the election of Mike Johnson of Louisiana as the new House speaker, the US has now got its federal government back. Without a speaker, Congress cannot function. For the past four weeks, the House of Representatives has been a phantom legislature. It has been absent without leave at a time of global crisis. The return to business is therefore better than a continuation of the paralysis on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nBut it has been obtained at a very high price. In September, the former speaker Kevin McCarthy made a deal with House Democrats to avoid a government shutdown. In revenge, eight implacable Republicans voted for Congressman Matt Gaetz’s motion to oust him, which passed with Democrat support. The Republican caucus then immobilised Congress through several failed attempts to elect a new speaker. Mr Johnson has now succeeded as he has accumulated fewer enemies, because pragmatists want an end to the impasse and because the right thinks that he is their man.\\n\\nIn other words, Mr Gaetz has won. He has orchestrated the removal of an establishment Republican House leader who was prepared, up to a point, to work with Democrats to keep government alive and to pass legislation, in favour of a relatively little-known rightwing Conservative who may not be. With a 17 November deadline looming for the renewal of government funding, Mr Johnson’s readiness to make the deals that a narrowly divided Congress like this one normally relies on will be put to the test soon. But making deals is not the culture of the Republican party today. And Mr Johnson knows that Mr Gaetz will be watching his every move.\\n\\nMr Johnson’s profile may be less confrontational than that of other possible candidates. But his record is the opposite of encouraging. He has strong religious conservative views on issues like abortion and same-sex marriage. He does not believe that human beings cause climate change. He has voted against aid to Ukraine. Above all, he supports Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 presidential election being rigged and stolen. He helped lead legal efforts to reverse the results of the election in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. He opposes attempts to bring Mr Trump to justice.\\n\\nThe speakership is powerful, but Mr Johnson is relatively inexperienced and there are big issues that need to be decided very quickly. They include the terms for the continuation of government funding, aid to Ukraine and military support for Israel. With Mr McCarthy now gone, it is possible that the right will cut Mr Johnson some slack. Certainly, the US cannot afford another month like this one. If nothing else, it should end the system that gives a single member of Congress, like Mr Gaetz, the power to bring the system to a halt.\\n\\nYet an even larger question stalks the coming months. The shambles of the last four weeks has been the exclusive responsibility of a dysfunctional Republican party, in hock to its dysfunctional former leader, and which no one can grip effectively without risking their career. At national level, the Republican party is now the institutional abnegation of good government. It will take more than Mr Johnson to change that.',\n",

Let’s see how the Information Warfare (IW) unfolded in this conflict (let me clarify: though IO and IW are contextually different, I am using them here synonymously). The moment the war broke out, social media went wild. Events overtook each other, and videos got uploaded from both sides, from bystanders, by media organisations.\\n\\nThe speed at which these happened, and the barbarity of it all, stunned not only the world but also the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). The subsequent response got delayed. Intentional videos were released by competing sides to prove their respective points. Truth was the first victim; whom and what to trust was the conundrum. The concomitant effect on the public was very pronounced.\\n\\nInformation Operations were not only carried out for surprise and deception but also for strategic coercion, for legitimacy to own operations and for international support. There were also situations where the opposing side's activities went on an unexpected tangent: the requirement of contingency planning emerged.\\n\\nHamas used seized social media accounts of kidnapped Israelis to broadcast violent messages and wage psychological warfare. Such rapidly evolving threats required close monitoring and appropriate response. Speed was of the essence as also the need to be proactive, staying ahead in the narrative. Misinformation was deliberately inserted and was difficult to detect: minor victories obtained by the other side appeared significant and had a demoralising effect. Tactical and strategic issues got enmeshed. The line between combatants and non-combatants got blurred.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nBasically, IW involves the use of media and communication capabilities to manipulate data (by careful insertion, deletion or alteration) and disseminate it to deceive the enemy, to undermine the quality of opposing sides’ information feed and to carry out psychological warfare. With the use of social media as a vector, it has also permeated into human-related aspects of decision-making, morale and building support.\\n\\nSuperior technology also permits one side to piggyback opposing side networks to connect, communicate and cut off -- all at vital moments in battle. Another rapidly developing capability is artificial intelligence (AI). AI bots can now respond to situations on their own, converse in a fluent manner and can be used in multiple roles for IO. Future wars will need to factor in information war facets into combat operations.\\n\\nIndia has a lot of catching up to do\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn the Indian context, we have two prominent inimical neighbours -- Pakistan and China -- of which the northern one is a superpower. It is enhancing its capabilities at an alarming pace. In the recent past, specifically in Ladakh, we were behind in the information war. The western adversary has its own agency, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) which also has developed considerable IW capabilities. We have a lot of catching up to do.\\n\\nWith Pakistan, we share language, history, religion and customs, so it is easy to anticipate what information operations it can attempt. The actual test will be to prevent enemy IO from breaching or exploiting its own ethnic cohesion. Pakistan has always attempted to destabilise our information space by spreading fabricated disinformation via IT bots, Pakistan-based handles, impersonation accounts and trolls. Their favourite themes are the treatment of minorities and Kashmir.\\n\\nCounteroperations are easier to plan and insert since Pakistan’s depth is limited, and language is no barrier, all means available to us can be used -- radio, TV, media, Internet and even our own diasporas. The broad spectrum of own IOs would aim at targeting Pakistan’s territorial integrity, history, identity, ideological cohesion, economy, international standing and ethnic strife and its previous losses to India.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nWith China, it is a different ballgame. China aims to deter and disrupt its opponent’s capability to use data by targeting its information system and decision-making process, thereby critically curtailing the adversary’s will or ability to fight. This is done across the global cyberspace, public web domains and social media platforms. China has in the past attempted IO, like in 2010 when it used the Stuxnet virus to infect our communication satellite.\\n\\nTwo years after that, it introduced malware in Eastern Naval Command’s computers. Similar attempts were also made against DRDO and ISRO, and after Galwan. Remember those videos of troops fighting and being captured? After these attempts, our systems have been suitably hardened and protected with countermeasures. Our IO with China suffers from a two-fold disadvantage -- language and curtailed freedom of the target population. China has its own Internet and permeating that for influence operations would be a huge challenge.\\n\\nThe need of the hour\\n\\nCapability development is thus required at two levels. At the national level, we need an IW organisation to counter non-combat threats which may emerge during battle, to maintain and protect national perspective, image and security concerns, use soft power influence to shape perceptions in the conflict (national and international) and attempt to erode enemy nation's credibility aimed at destabilising it.\\n\\nBasic tasks will include challenging and authenticating the enemy’s disinformation campaign, its rebuttal, tracking the flow of information, and move to counter (and block) the enemy’s networks. Lastly, formulate narratives supporting own operations and project these leveraging traditional media and current digital platforms. The list is not exhaustive.\\n\\nWith the national level organisation doing its job diligently, at the armed forces level, the requirement will be protecting own military assets, thereafter intermeshing psychological warfare, cyber warfare, strategic deception with tactical operational plans and dissemination of these not only through traditional means but also by social media.\\n\\nFor this, the armed forces need enhanced capability of monitoring the social media domain, and the means to quickly verify information to activate contingency plans. An organisation will have to evolve with structures which facilitate these abilities. The present strategic communication organisations in the services are inadequately equipped for this. A dynamic structure is needed, perhaps flowing down from a tri-service apex body.\\n\\n(The writer is an infantry veteran and has served in critical higher command structures.

       " {'articleBody': 'The October 7 surprise attack by Hamas on Israel was planned and communicated using a network of hardwired phones built in a network of tunnels underneath Gaza, recent US Intelligence reports have unveiled.\\n\\nThe phone lines in the tunnels allowed Hamas operatives to communicate with one another in secret and cannot be tracked by Israeli officials, according to a report in CNN.\\n\\nThe Israel Defense Forces have referred to the tunnels built by Hamas over the last decades as the “Gaza metro.”\\n\\nThe underground tunnel system used by Hamas have a series of advantages: store rockets and ammunition caches, passage between Hamas controlled areas and smuggle weapons, fighters or other contraband from Egypt to Gaza.\\n\\nHistory of the ‘Gaza Metro’ Tunnels\\n\\nSince the 1980s, the tunnels have been an integral part of the life in Gaza. However, its significance increased after Hamas removed Fatah from the seat of power and severe restrictions were imposed on the movement of goods and people by Israel and Egypt on the territory.\\n\\nGaza’s 14-kilometre border with Egypt was burrowed under with hundreds of tunnels used to smuggle fighters, weapons and other contraband — although many have now been destroyed. However, some of the tunnels located across their border with Gaza were destroyed by Egypt.\\n\\nDuring the 2014 Gaza war, Palestinian gunmen used tunnels to blindside Israeli forces. Since then, Israel has been developing detection technologies and constructed an underground concrete barrier with sensors to foil attempts to dig across the border.\\n\\nThe passageways have been a mystery for the world forever with very little known about it in the outside world. Israel has repeatedly raised the issue of Hamas operating these tunnels beneath Gaza.\\n\\nIsrael’s army and intelligence became aware about a portion of the network and bombarded it heavily in 2021. However, a large part of the tunnel system remains secret and will make any Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ground operation in Gaza more difficult.\\n\\nAll About ‘Gaza Metro’\\n\\nThe narrow web of streets in Gaza, one of the most populated areas in the world, is doubled underground by a dense tunnel network or the “Gaza Metro”. The labyrinths of tunnel are believed to be 41 km long and 10 km wide. But in 2021, Hamas claimed to have built 500 km of tunnels under Gaza, though it is unclear if the figure was accurate.\\n\\nBut since 2014, Hamas has been digging underground pathways to get around territory it controls. Some tunnels are as deep as 30 or 40 metres below ground, allowing militants to change position away from the danger of strikes.\\n\\nWe have all now heard about how bad #Hamas tunnels are, but what can the @IDF do about them? Fill with cement, seawater, smoke? Bunker busters? I sat down with @RichemondBarak on my #podcast to discuss it all. Have a listen. https://t.co/kXN3Jxk85M— John Spencer (@SpencerGuard) October 20, 2023\\n\\nRocket batteries hidden just a few metres beneath the surface can be uncovered with a trapdoor just for the time it takes to fire a salvo.\\n\\nHamas “knows its tunnels by heart,” Colin Clarke, research director at the New York-based Soufan Center think-tank said. He added that “some are probably booby-trapped. Preparing to fight in such terrain… would require extensive intelligence… which the Israelis may not have.”\\n\\nWhy are These Tunnels Valuable\\n\\nTunnels have been an efficient tool of warfare since a long time. Currently, they offer militant groups like Hamas an edge in asymmetric warfare, negating the technological advantages and advanced military which the Israeli forces have.\\n\\nThe vast network of tunnels has been crucial since the Gaza territory has been under a land, sea and air blockade by Israel and a land blockade by Egypt since 2007 as well.\\n\\nHamas has been using the tunnels underneath the Egyptian border for smuggling fuels, weapons and commercial goods by Palestinian-based groups. The tunnels beneath Gaza have also been used to transport people and goods and store rockets and ammunition caches and house Hamas command safe from Israeli aircraft and surveillance drones.\\n\\nRole in Attacks Against Israel\\n\\nIsraelis have often referred to these as “terror tunnels” and further restricted the entry of construction materials into the Gaza Strip.\\n\\nIn 2006, Hamas captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalid and killed his two colleagues in a cross-border raid using tunnels, according to a report in Wion. The soldier remained under Hamas control for two years before he was released under a prisoner exchange deal.\\n\\nIn 2013, the Israel Defence Forces discovered a 1.6 km-long, 18m-deep tunnel with concrete roof and walls. The tunnel, which ran from the Gaza Strip to land near an Israeli kibbutz, was found after strange sounds were heard by the residents.\\n\\nIn 2020, Israel discovered a new cross-border tunnel from the Gaza Strip and its military said extended “dozens of metres underground” and into southern Israel.\\n\\nWhile Israel relies on bunker buster bombs and Merkava tanks, it has to tackle booby traps while Hamas operatives aware of the underground network use it to strike, hide and escape.\\n\\nIt’s also tough for Israel military to locate the tunnels, which may be under buildings or structures. However, there are several ways to do so, including using radar and other detection techniques that can measure thermal patterns, magnetic signatures and acoustics, according to DW.\\n\\nRole in Latest October Attacks\\n\\nThe shocking attacks by Hamas which shook Israel earlier this month was a combination of simultaneous attacks via air, water, land and rocket strikes. The Israel’s border with Gaza remains fenced and has sensors installed which can detect movement.\\n\\nAccording to experts, the tunnels may have played an important role in the undetected crossing of Hamas operatives into Israel. The fence built by Israel on the border with is 30 feet high and has an underground concrete barrier.\\n\\nTherefore, the only way Hamas operatives were able to enter Israel undetected would have been using tunnels under the barrier and the fence. Released Israeli hostages have also stated that the tunnels were used to keep them. Yocheved Lifshitz described the “unimaginable hell” of her kidnapping ordeal that included being held in a “spiderweb” of wet tunnels after she was abducted from Israel.\\n\\n(With inputs from agencies)',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'by Janina Dill\\n\\nDuring previous military operations in Gaza, Israel’s leadership sustained a remarkably disciplined message about Israel’s commitment to international law, often claiming that its military operations not only met legal demands, but exceeded them. Israel nonetheless faced allegations of non-compliance with the laws of war, for instance, the criticism from scholars and civil society organizations that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) caused disproportionate collateral damage in Gaza in 2009 and 2014. Such criticism was met with official rebuttals, vociferous denials by Israeli commentators, and scholarly articles dedicated to defending Israel as the “most moral army in the world,” with a “track record of preserving human rights under the difficult conditions of urban conflict [that] is commendable.”\\n\\nAll seems different now. While some legal experts still express “faith in the Israeli military, lawyers and their system,” the message this system is broadcasting to the world features significantly fewer mentions of international law than in the past. When Israel’s political and military leadership have acknowledged the laws of war, allies have been reluctant to publicly press for details on how operations in Gaza meet legal requirements. Meanwhile, statements by Israel’s senior political and military leadership routinely fail to differentiate between Hamas and Palestinian civilians, admit to the use of the civilian population as a means to compel Hamas, cast doubt over whether Palestinians deserve protection from attack, and legitimize their collective punishment for the horrific terror attacks of Oct. 7. This change in discourse, and the change in conduct that it hints at, are a grave error with devastating legal, strategic, and moral implications.\\n\\nLegal Implications\\n\\nStatements by the senior military and political leadership have evidentiary value in a legal evaluation of Israel’s current operations. Some violations of international law’s rules for the conduct of hostilities are not visible in military operations alone, but depend on their purpose. To identify indiscriminate attacks, the use of starvation as a method of war, or forced displacement, more is required than an attack that kills, starves, or displaces civilians. However, when Israel’s Defense and Energy Ministers both express the intent to compel Hamas by depriving the Gaza strip of fuel, food, and water, initiating a siege with devastating humanitarian consequences, there is a plausible legal case to be made concerning the criminal use of starvation as a method of war. When viewed against the backdrop of Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s statement that “an entire nation” of Palestinian civilians is responsible for supporting Hamas, Israel’s bombing of densely populated neighborhoods in Gaza starts to look like recklessly caused civilian harm. An evacuation order may become a violation of the prohibition on forced displacement if it is necessary primarily because the IDF is destroying residential buildings in an unlawful manner.\\n\\nCrucially, Hamas’ acts of terrorism on Oct. 7 do not raise the question of evidence for intent or questions about purpose in the same way. The murder, abduction, and sexual assault of civilians, including children and the elderly, in their homes and at a music festival, are acts easily classed not only as violations of international humanitarian law (IHL), but also as war crimes. These heinous acts are unambiguous in their intent: harm and terrorize Israel’s civilian population. The additional evidentiary value of statements expressing such intent is therefore lower. For Israel, by contrast, the discursive abandonment of international law and expressions that betray the intent to harm Palestinians have legal implications. More evidence would, of course, be required in a criminal trial of individuals involved in these acts, for instance before the International Criminal Court, which has jurisdiction. But the argument that all IDF operations are compatible with IHL is decreasingly plausible. This, meanwhile, has strategic implications.\\n\\nStrategic Implications\\n\\nLegality affects public support for the use of force in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. Studies have shown that the claim that a policy violates international law decreases public support for drone strikes, aerial bombing, torture, military intervention, domestic human rights violations, or the poor treatment of refugees. Notably, the effect of framing these policies as illegal is relatively modest. Support for bombing civilians decreases by 9% and for drone strikes by 6%, for example, when these policies are framed as violating international law.\\n\\nYet, the question is not only whether the public responds to claims about the legality of military operations, but also whether it prefers operations that comply with the laws of war, in the first place. For instance, does public support for military operations depend on whether and how they cause civilian casualties? One study of American respondents indeed shows that air strikes that conform to international law meet with more support than those that do not, even when international law is not mentioned. Americans prefer air strikes against combatants to those against civilians and air strikes against military objectives to air strikes against civilian objects, even when the operations’ contributions to victory is the same. Significantly, Americans do not seem to care whether civilians contribute to the war — they simply prefer strikes that minimize harm to individuals designated as civilians.\\n\\nIn short, a body of scholarly work suggests that legality, both claims of compliance with international law and actually choosing targets that conform to international law, bolsters public support for military operations specifically in the United States. But when we bring these studies in conversation with Israel’s current operations in Gaza two significant caveats emerge. First, the concern that many ordinary people display for civilian casualties is fragile. Studies suggest that people are ready to sacrifice many foreign civilians if this is necessary for military victory or for keeping their own troops out of harm’s way. Second, Western publics, specifically the British and American publics who have been shown to care about international law, fight wars of choice far away from their own territory. Should we expect Israelis, who live with the threat of rocket fire and terrorist attacks to have the same views about international law and the importance of protecting non-compatriot civilians?\\n\\nIndeed, Israel is one of a handful of countries in which researchers have found backlash effects against international law. That means a (very!) modest increase in support for a policy that is framed as violating international law. Moreover, two studies that directly compare respondents from different countries have shown that Israelis are more hawkish than people in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom and that they are willing to risk even larger numbers of foreign civilians in order to keep their own soldiers safe than American or British respondents. One determinant of individual respondents’ approach to trading off risk to their own soldiers for risk to foreign civilians is whether they perceive their soldiers as freely consenting to risk taking. This belief is naturally more widespread in countries with professional armed forces than in Israel, which relies on conscription and views its soldiers as, in the words of Aser Kasher and Amos Yadlin, “citizen[s] in military uniform.”\\n\\nAt the individual level, retributiveness – often measured as support for capital punishment or agreement with statements such as “those who hurt others deserve to be hurt in return” – is a strong predictor for whether a person supports the use of force and how easily they tolerate foreign civilian casualties. Israelis have reason to feel retributive after the national trauma of Hamas’ recent terror attacks. Israel is also a society with significant inter-generational trauma. As Daphna Canetti and colleagues have argued “for Israeli Jews, the Holocaust constitutes a collective national trauma that plays a key role in shaping identity, politics and culture.” Moreover, Israel has experienced a continuous threat to its existence and exposure to this threat has been linked to confrontational attitudes toward outgroups. Given this domestic audience, Israeli leaders may not feel the need to give law a prominent place in messaging surrounding the current conflict.\\n\\nYet, if Israel abandons international law or if it is seen to have skirted it through implausible interpretations, that is strategically disastrous for Israel. To understand why, we must take other crucial audiences into account. The staunchest allies of Israel are Western democracies whose governments cannot, in the long run, support Israel militarily if their publics turn against it. It therefore matters that claims about compliance with international law and actual conformity with international law sustain public support for military operations in the United Kingdom and the United States. That pictures of mass deaths in Gaza further inflame publics already predisposed to enmity toward Israel should be self-evident. While we lack studies about how the perceived legality of a conflict impacts popular support for it in the Middle East, it is obvious that regional populations care about the protection of Palestinian civilians. A regional escalation of the conflict, meanwhile would be devastating for Israel’s security.\\n\\nAnd then there are the Palestinians themselves. As Stathis Kalyvas first showed, most forms of indiscriminate violence against civilians are “at best ineffective and at worst counterproductive.” Studies that have investigated civilians’ attitudes show that aerial bombings of civilians, mass killings, terrorism, and attacks based on group membership are all associated with poor strategic outcomes. Populations affected by inter-state wars over territory, in particular, become “intransigent” and withdraw support from negotiations the more affected they themselves are by violence. Harms perceived as intentional or unnecessary – those that are most likely to violate the legal rules of distinction and precaution – are associated with particularly strong rejection of the attacking party.\\n\\nTragically, the very same determinants that likely account for why, in comparative studies, Israel’s population looks more hawkish than the British and U.S. publics – exposure to threat and violence – predict that further indiscriminate harming of the Palestinian population will only harden attitudes and block routes to peace both now and in the future. Indeed, in both Israel and Palestine, civilians more directly exposed to retaliation to terror attacks, as well as those that witness house-demolitions or experience rocket fire, have been shown to be less supportive of peace negotiations and more ”radical” in their voting choices. Put differently, everything we know about conflict-affected populations, including Israelis and Palestinians, suggests that harming them deliberately or indiscriminately makes them more willing to assume the costs of resistance. Empirical studies of conflict give us little reason to believe that harming thousands of civilians makes either side any safer.\\n\\nMoral Implications\\n\\nIt may seem odd to make strategic arguments for compliance with international law. Should not a moral argument suffice to motivate restraint and the protection of civilians? It should, but it is crucial to recognize just how traumatic Hamas’ attacks of Oct. 7 were. Some Israeli voices known to be committed to international law have recently suggested that Israel is now facing an existential struggle for survival, which changes the role it can afford international law. Indeed, there is a long tradition in legal theory for the argument that law should not govern an emergency. In the famous words of Alexander Hamilton, when the life of a nation is threatened, “no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the power to which the care of it is committed.” But where does a rejection of international law leave us in this conflict?\\n\\nIn the absence of law, morality might fill the void. What are Israelis and Palestinians morally permitted to do to defend themselves? From a moral perspective, the permissibility of resorting to violence chiefly depends on whether it serves a just aim (though even a war fought for a just cause may be unjustified if, for example, it fails to be proportional). In a conflict in which one side justifies collective punishment as resistance to terrorism and the other side justifies collective punishment as resistance to occupation, such a moral analysis is unlikely to lead either side to restraint.\\n\\nDepressingly, moral arguments are unlikely to reduce moral wrongdoing.\\n\\nInternational law, meanwhile, imposes the same obligations on all parties to an armed conflict regardless of their causes or ends. It upholds these obligations even when one side violates them. Who started it, who behaved worse, whose aims are more important — all questions that govern our moral intuitions about the permissibility of violence — are questions that the laws of war bracket. While this makes international law appear morally defective, it is law’s greatest moral asset in a conflict in which both sides have legitimate grievances, and where no neutral party exists to arbitrate between them. When even neutral observers intensely disagree on who has a just cause, international law remains a ground for normative claims that remain intelligible across the divide. Israel’s interlocutor may not be Hamas, but other Palestinian and regional actors. If both parties did what they thought morality licensed them to do, things would hardly get better. If both parties – or even if just one party as my optimism is not so boundless as to consider Hamas amenable to this plea – only did what international law licensed them to do, moral wrongdoing would be significantly reduced, much suffering would be avoided.\\n\\nTo be sure, legal arguments ring hollow to those reeling from the loss of loved ones. But their leaders should know better. Precisely when two peoples threaten each other’s survival, legality is not a luxury they can no longer afford. Rather it becomes their last barrier against a moral race to the bottom, a normative minimum standard that third parties standing with either side need to insist on. International law is critical to survival in Israel and Palestine.\\n\\nImage: Smoke ascends over the northern Gaza Strip following an Israeli air strike on October 20, 2023, amidst ongoing fighting between Israel and Hamas (Photo by JACK GUEZ/AFP via Getty Images).',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'The Biden administration says it is pushing to avoid regional escalation while fully backing Israel’s bombing campaign.\\n\\nWashington, DC – The United States is firmly resisting calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but as the war rages on — killing thousands and risking an all-out regional conflict — questions are arising over its aims in backing the Israeli offensive.\\n\\nUS President Joe Biden has pledged unconditional support for Israel while warning against an expansion of the conflict, two goals that experts have said amount to competing priorities.\\n\\n“Not only are they at odds with each other, but the higher priority of the administration appears to be supporting Israel, rather than making sure that there is no dangerous escalation,” said Trita Parsi, executive vice president at the Quincy Institute, a think tank that promotes diplomacy.\\n\\nUS officials said they are asking Israel “tough” questions about its military operation in Gaza, including what the war’s long-term objectives are. However, Washington’s own endgame remains largely undefined.\\n\\nThe White House has repeatedly denied any “intention to put US boots on the ground”. But the US is nevertheless bolstering its military presence in the region, and according to recent media reports, the Pentagon has sent advisers to help Israel plan its looming ground invasion of Gaza.\\n\\nAnd despite Biden’s stated desire not to see the conflict expand, there are indications that it may still. There have been frequent clashes between Israel and the armed group Hezbollah in Lebanon, and US troops in the region have suffered targeted — albeit limited — attacks blamed on Iran-allied groups in recent days.\\n\\nWhile these skirmishes remain contained, analysts warned that they could quickly escalate by design or miscalculation.\\n\\nThe U.S. and our regional partners are working to build a better future for the Middle East – one where it is more stable and better connected to its neighbors. It benefits the people of the Middle East – and it would benefit us. — President Biden (@POTUS) October 24, 2023\\n\\nNo clear objectives\\n\\nSo what is the US plan beyond enabling the Israeli military campaign logistically with military aid and politically with diplomatic cover at international forums?\\n\\n“There does not appear to be a clear endgame from the Biden administration,” Parsi said. “When it comes to this strategic image, it’s very difficult to be able to discern a clear strategy that actually would have the desired results.”\\n\\nThe conflict began on October 7, when the Palestinian group Hamas launched a surprise attack against Israel from Gaza. More than 1,400 people were killed, and dozens were taken captive.\\n\\nIsrael responded with a declaration of war the following day. It has since led a continuing bombing campaign that has killed more than 6,500 Palestinians in Gaza.\\n\\nAdam Shapiro, director of advocacy for Israel-Palestine at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), a US-based rights group, said it appears that the Biden administration has not “formulated” a clear objective despite fully backing Israel’s war in Gaza.\\n\\nBiden has called for eliminating Hamas, but Shapiro said military efforts to root out the group are unlikely to succeed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“So for them to be launching this kind of open-ended, unclear mission with a big named goal in mind that bears no resemblance to reality just seems [like] folly,” he said.\\n\\n“And I’m sure it’s going to come back eventually to harm American interests in the long term.”\\n\\nEven more unclear, Shapiro added, is the fate of Gaza after a prospective Israeli ground invasion.\\n\\nBiden has voiced opposition to re-establishing a permanent Israeli presence inside the besieged Palestinian territory, as it had in the past. From 1967 until 2005, thousands of Israeli ground troops were stationed there.\\n\\nBrian Finucane, senior adviser for the US programme at the Crisis Group think tank, drew a parallel between the ambiguity of Israel’s endgame in Gaza and questions about US strategy.\\n\\n“The US objective in supporting Israel is undefined to some extent because Israel’s own objectives in Gaza are undefined,” Finucane told Al Jazeera.\\n\\nHe added that even if Israel topples Hamas, it has not articulated what might replace the Palestinian group, which currently governs Gaza.\\n\\nFinucane also said “there appears to be some tension” between Washington’s support for Israel and its push to avoid a wider conflict. If the Biden administration is unsuccessful in deterring Iran and its allies from widening the conflict, a larger, regional war could end up involving US forces.\\n\\n“And that should give policymakers in the Biden administration real pause. They should consider taking the advice they’re offering to the Israelis themselves: Think through how is it going to play out,” Finucane told Al Jazeera.\\n\\n“What is the US endgame if we were to — God forbid — get into an armed conflict with Hezbollah, or a deepening conflict with Iran-back groups that are targeting US forces in Iraq and Syria with drones?”\\n\\n‘Negative consequences’\\n\\nAfter the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, politicians on both sides of the aisle have called for restraint in any future military endeavours, reflecting wider public fatigue towards overseas conflict.\\n\\nBut Finucane said the “atrocities” of Hamas’s attack on October 7 “have shifted the conversation” in Washington.\\n\\nShibley Telhami, a professor for peace and development at the University of Maryland, said neither the US nor Iran seem interested in a broader military confrontation.\\n\\n“However, they all could be dragged into this by some miscalculation or huge expansion of the war in Gaza,” Telhami said.\\n\\nHe stressed that the US should not blindly back Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war efforts, as that stance might trigger direct American engagement in the conflict.\\n\\n“You cannot leave that in the hands of an extremist Israeli government, whose ministers are known to have views that are both at odds with American interests and at odds with American values,” Telhami told Al Jazeera earlier this month.\\n\\nParsi, of the Quincy Institute, also stressed that attempts to deter Iran from joining the fray could prove to be unsuccessful without applying pressure to Israel as well to show restraint.\\n\\n“It will very well lead to the very nightmare scenario I think the Biden administration wants to avoid,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor now, the Biden administration is allowing Israel to carry out its intense bombing campaign, which has wiped out entire families in Gaza, according to Amnesty International. US officials have ruled out even discussing a ceasefire, saying that those conversations would ultimately benefit Hamas.\\n\\nWashington is also preparing a $14bn aid package for Israel, including billions in military assistance.\\n\\nJon Hoffman, a foreign policy analyst at the CATO Institute, a libertarian think tank, connected the current US policy to its broader approach in the Middle East.\\n\\n“I don’t know the Biden administration has a clear objective here besides praying this doesn’t spiral into a broader regional conflict,” he told Al Jazeera.\\n\\n“It should be clear from the past several decades that continuing to throw money, weapons and military assets at the region often has negative consequences.”',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'In a series of videos posted on Telegram by a shadowy organization known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, drones belonging to Iranian-backed militias can be seen taking off from the desert floor and streaking into the distance. The videos are paired with ominous texts threatening further strikes and warning Iraqis to stay away from U.S. military bases in Iraq and Syria, the targets of the attacks. The location of the videos could not be independently verified by TIME, but metadata from the videos indicates that the videos were taken on days of confirmed attacks on U.S. military bases.\\n\\nFor more than six months, Iranian-backed groups have refrained from launching drones or rockets against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. But in the wake of Hamas’s Oct. 7 assault on Israel which left more than 1,400 people dead, this period of relative calm has come to a sudden halt. In just the past week, U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have been attacked 13 times, Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder said at a press conference on Oct. 24. While the attacks have been largely intercepted by U.S. missile defenses, 24 U.S. troops have been injured, Ryder said. One U.S. contractor also died from cardiac arrest during a false alarm at an air base in Iraq.\\n\\nWhile the U.S. has long sought to reduce its military forces in the Middle East, the repeated attacks by Iranian-backed groups complicate the U.S.’s presence in the region and underscores the risks of further escalation.\\n\\nHere’s what to know about the groups threatening or attacking U.S. forces in the region.\\n\\nWho Are the Groups Attacking U.S. Military Bases?\\n\\nPentagon spokesperson Ryder said on Oct. 23 that the U.S. does not have any intelligence proving that Iran “explicitly ordered” the recent attacks. Even so, administration officials have not been shying away from pointing to Iran’s role in encouraging its proxies. One senior defense official told reporters on Oct. 23, “it\\'s fair to say when you see this uptick in activity and attacks by many of these groups, there\\'s Iranian fingerprints all over it.”\\n\\nAcross the Middle East, Iran has a network of proxy forces in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Gaza and Bahrain. While many of the groups also have their own local agendas, they receive training, weapons and funds from Iran and bolster Tehran’s influence in the region.\\n\\nRead more: Militant Group Hezbollah Is on the Sidelines of the Israel-Hamas War. Here’s What to Know\\n\\nOne network in particular, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, has taken credit for at least 11 attacks on U.S. troops so far, according to the Washington Institute. The group first appeared in the aftermath of Hamas’s attacks on Israel, and is an umbrella organization for a number of key Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, says Michael Knights, an expert in militias in Iraq and Syria at the Washington Institute. The groups have come together under this banner “to signal unity but also to hide individual culpability for attacks” if they happen to kill an American, he says.\\n\\nIt is unclear precisely how many Iranian-backed groups operate in Iraq and Syria, experts say. “There\\'s at least 10 or 20, if not many more groups between the Iraq-Syria border alone,” says Behnam Ben Taleblu, an Iran expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. These groups pose a threat primarily to the 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq and the 900 in Syria. But at least one Iranian-backed group in Iraq, the Righteous Promise Brigades, has threatened to attack U.S. forces in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.\\n\\nWhat Happens if the Attacks Escalate?\\n\\nThe militia groups have been clear in linking their latest escalations to the U.S’s support for Israel. \"The Americans are essential partners in killing the people of Gaza and therefore they must bear the consequences,\" Jaafar al Hussein, spokesman of Kataib Hezbollah, one of Iraq’s largest militia groups, wrote on Telegram on Oct. 18.\\n\\nThe attacks on U.S. military bases so far are the largest barrage of attacks since the Iranian response to the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020, experts say. So far, the attacks have been small-scale rocket or drone strikes at military bases designed to withstand these kinds of attacks, says Knights, rather than large-scale attacks aimed at overwhelming air defenses and killing large numbers of U.S. forces.\\n\\nEven so, experts say that if the attacks were to kill U.S. forces, the situation may escalate dramatically. “You don\\'t launch rockets and missiles and armed drones into populated areas such as bases without a willingness to kill,” says Afshon Ostovar, an associate professor at the Naval Postgraduate School. “And if you\\'re going to commit lethal attacks, the escalatory ladder or dynamic that follows is never a sure thing.”\\n\\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Sunday Oct. 22 that “what we’re seeing is a prospect of a significant escalation of attacks on our troops and our people throughout the region.”\\n\\nIf the groups decide to intensify the attacks on U.S. forces further, experts say that attacks on U.S. helicopters flying over Iraq or a return to the widespread usage of roadside bombs that killed thousands of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan could be likely strategies.\\n\\nThe Houthi Threat\\n\\nIn the Red Sea, the USS Carney shot down several missiles and drones that were fired by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels on Oct. 19. U.S. officials say they were not fired at the American navy destroyer, but may have been aimed for Israel. Houthi leader Abdel-Malek al-Houthi warned shortly after Hamas’s attack on Israel that if the U.S. were to get directly involved in Gaza, that his group would respond with missiles and drones.\\n\\nWhile the Houthi army is more than 1,400 miles from the Israel-Hamas war, they possess some of the most advanced capabilities of any of the Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East. “They are significantly ramping up their long range strike capabilities,” says Behnam Ben Taleblu of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, “which allows them to be a more effective press against international shipping and American power in the Red Sea and Bab-el-Mandeb,” the narrow strait separating Yemen from East Africa.\\n\\nIn response to the rising threats, the U.S. is rushing air defense systems to its Middle Eastern military facilities and has tightened security around its bases. The U.S. has also sent a number of ships, including two aircraft carriers, and additional fighter jets to the region as it seeks to deter Iran and its allies from getting involved further.\\n\\n“The United States does not seek conflict with Iran,” Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said at a tense meeting of the UN Security Council on Oct. 24. “But if Iran or its proxies attack U.S. personnel anywhere, make no mistake: We will defend our people, we will defend our security—swiftly and decisively.”',\n",

Instagram/@bellahadid\\n\\n“My heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood,” she continued, “Seeing the aftermath from the airstrikes in Gaza, I mourn with all the mothers who have lost children and the children who cry alone, all the lost fathers, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunties, friends that will never again walk this earth.”\\n\\nYet she also “mourns for the Israeli families that have been dealing of the pain and aftermath” since Hamas’ surprise attack on October 7.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“Regardless of the history of the land, I condemn the terrorist attacks on any civilians, anywhere,” she wrote. “Harming women and children and inflicting terror does not and should not do any good for the Free Palestine movement.”\\n\\n5 Hadid, who is half Palestinian, says her “heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma [she is] seeing unfold.” Getty Images\\n\\nHowever, she then went on to explain some of her Palestinian heritage and why she has advocated for the “Free Palestine” movement for so many years.\\n\\n“Its important to understand the hardship of what it is to be Palestinian, in a world that sees us as nothing more than terrorists resisting peace,” she continued. “It is harmful, it is shameful and it is categorically untrue.”\\n\\nHadid’s father, Mohamed Hadid, was born in Nazareth in 1948 — the same year that 750,000 Palestinians were displaced from their homes — and his family was forced to become refugees, Hadid shared.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n5 “It’s important to understand the hardship of what it is to be Palestinian, in a world that sees us as nothing more than terrorists resisting peace,” she continued. “It is harmful, it is shameful and it is categorically untrue.” Getty Images\\n\\n“My family witnessed 75 years of violence against Palestinian people – most notably, brutal settler invasions which led to the destruction of entire communities, murder in cold blood and the forcible removal of families from their homes,” she continued. “The practice of settlements on Palestinian land still continues to this day.”\\n\\nYet Hadid sees a future where all people can “stand together in defending humanity and compassion” against “corrupt” governments — no matter their side.\\n\\n“We are one, and God has created us all equal. All bloodshed, tears, and bodies should be mourned in the same respect.”\\n\\n5 The model finished the post by calling on people from each side to come together so that “innocent Palestinian civilians are not the forgotten casualties of war.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nShe then called for people to help the current “humanitarian crisis in Gaza” for people who lack access to clean water, power to run hospitals and medics to tend to the wounded.\\n\\n“Wars have laws — and they must be upheld, no matter what.”\\n\\nIn her final remarks, she urged her followers to “keep pressure on our leaders” to “ensure that innocent Palestinian civilians are not the forgotten casualties of war.”\\n\\n“I stand with humanity, knowing that peace and safety belong to us.”',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Oversimplification of Palestinian identity diminishes their rich and complicated history and reduces the decades-long struggle to a solely religious war.\\n\\nPalestine flags. (Photo credit: Wikimedia Commons)\\n\\nNew Delhi: The oversimplification of Palestinian identity has been a characteristic of the ongoing media coverage of the newest deadly episode of the Israel-Palestine conflict. In general, particularly in India, the focus has been on Palestinians as Muslims arrayed against Jewish Israelis.\\n\\nThis diminishes the Palestinians’ rich and complicated history and reduces the decades-long struggle to a solely religious war.\\n\\nAlso read: Amazon rainforest: Why is there a drought in Earth’s lungs?\\n\\nWe shall attempt to describe the complicated history of Palestinians in this post.\\n\\nPalestine’s History\\n\\nPalestine is the eastern Mediterranean region that includes sections of contemporary Israel as well as the Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip (along the Mediterranean Sea coast) and the West Bank (west of the Jordan River).\\n\\nThe word Palestine has been widely and sometimes controversially connected with this little territory, which some claim also includes Jordan, as per Britannica. Over the period of three millennia, both the physical area represented by the name and its political position have altered.\\n\\nThe territory (or at least a portion of it) is known as the Holy Land and is revered by Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike. Since the twentieth century, Jerusalem has been the site of rival claims by Jewish and Arab national groups, resulting in lengthy bloodshed and, in some cases, open combat.\\n\\nThe meaning of the name and its origin\\n\\nThe term Palestine is derived from Philistia, the name given by Greek historians to the land of the Philistines, who held a tiny pocket of territory on the southern shore between present Tel Aviv-Yafo and Gaza in the 12th century BCE.\\n\\nAlso read: Israel-Hamas conflict: The diplomatic ties which have ensured that UK backs the Jewish country\\n\\nAfter Roman times, the name had no official status until after World War I and the Ottoman Empire’s end of rule, when it was adopted for one of the regions mandated to Great Britain; in addition to an area roughly comprising present-day Israel and the West Bank, the mandate included the territory east of the Jordan River now constituting the Hashimite Kingdom of Jordan, which Britain placed under a separate administration from that of Palestine immediately after recognising Palestine.\\n\\nFrom the outset, Palestine was used primarily as a location name — and later, as a moniker for the people who lived in the territory, regardless of race or religion. As a result, while employing the phrase, Roman records make no distinction between Christians and Jews.\\n\\nFollowing the Arab conquest of the Levant in the 7th century CE, the word Palestine was largely dropped from official use. This lasted into the twentieth century. However, it remained prevalent in local usage and was adopted into Arabic as “Filasteen”. Indeed, Palestine is spelt “Filisteen” in Hindi.\\n\\nDemography\\n\\nThe extraordinary political upheavals and battles that have brought this little territory to the attention of the world have had a significant impact on the social geography of contemporary Palestine, particularly the area west of the Jordan River.\\n\\nIn the early twenty-first century, Israeli Jews made up around half of the population west of Jordan, while Palestinian Arabs (Muslim, Christian, and Druze) and other minorities made up the rest. Although millions of immigrants have come since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the Jewish population is increasingly made up of people born in Israel.\\n\\nAlso read: Explained: What is a ‘nuclear briefcase’ that Vladimir Putin travels with?\\n\\nThe Arab population is descended from Arabs who resided in the region during the mandate period and, in most cases, for centuries prior. The bulk of Jews and Arabs today live in cities.\\n\\nJudaism, according to Jewish nationalists (Zionists), serves as a foundation for both religious and national (ethnic) identity.\\n\\nPalestinian nationalists frequently emphasise that their shared Arab identity transcends their community’s religious diversity. Both Muslim Arabs (18% of the Israeli population) and Christian Arabs (2% of the population) identify as Arabs in the first instance.\\n\\nToday, the word Palestinians refers to individuals who live in the State of Palestine (West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem), as well as those who have fled the former British Mandate and moved elsewhere. Some Israelis who reside in Palestinian territory may also identify as Palestinians.\\n\\nFull coverage of Israel Gaza war\\n\\nVideo: Hezbollah attacks Israeli military posts, destroys surveillance towers\\n\\nVideo: After Biden’s visit, Hamas resumes rocket attacks from Gaza Strip towards Israel\\n\\nExplained: Israel-Hamas conflict: Strong US support for Israel at the United Nations over the decades\\n\\nDon’t Miss: How the United States has supported Israel over the years',\n",

Upon fact-checking, similar other visuals from 2016, unrelated to the current flare-up, were also found to be falsely linked to the recent violence.\\n\\nA quick search on the artificial intelligence supported platform Chat GPT indicates that reports of minors being targeted by Hamas are unverified and probably false.\\n\\nA recent Al Jazeera article underlines the fact that most anti-Palestine disinformation originated from India. It also highlights the rise of online disinformation spread by far-right accounts in India.\\n\\nAn Al Jazeera mentions that accounts allegedly linked to the ‘BJP IT cell’ have been actively spreading disinformation related to the latest Israel–Palestine flare-up.\\n\\nThe article mentions that accounts allegedly linked to the infamous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ‘IT cell’ have been actively spreading disinformation on the Israel–Palestine conflict.\\n\\n‘BJP IT cell’ is a broad-based term used to describe the social media and online communication wing of the Hindu right-wing party which is currently the ruling regime in India. The party’s IT cell plays a significant role in shaping its online presence, disseminating information, and engaging with supporters and critics alike.\\n\\nThe Indian disinformation campaign includes false claims of Hamas kidnapping a Jewish baby and a video falsely depicting Palestinians kidnapping people to be made sex slaves.\\n\\nThe Al Jazeera article finds that many of the accounts sharing these false videos also engaged in posting anti-Muslim comments on social media platforms. Such narratives only serve to flame hatred and disseminate Islamophobia and hate speech online.\\n\\nFake news for more views\\n\\nWhen global crises and emergencies occur, whether it is the Covid pandemic or warring countries, technology is often co-opted to serve the narrative of powerful stakeholders.\\n\\nIn such situations, online sources that usually connect people around the world and provide access to critical information become a tool to manipulate public sentiment.\\n\\nAccusations of people, including children, being used as shields in both Israel and Palestine are not new. In fact, the long-drawn conflict between Israel and Palestine has been marred by accusations and counter-accusations regarding the use of human shields, particularly involving children. Both sides have made such claims against each other, including in 2018 and 2007.\\n\\nIsraeli forces deliberately place civilians, including children, in harm’s way to deter attacks or to gain a tactical advantage, as observed by Amnesty International and the United Nations, who have documented cases where Palestinians were allegedly coerced or forced to act as human shields. On the other hand, Israel has accused Hamas of deliberately using Israelis and Palestinians, including children, as human shields.\\n\\nThe highly polarised nature of the conflict often leads to conflicting narratives and interpretations of events. Further, investigations into these allegations are often hindered by limited access to conflict zones and the lack of cooperation from both sides.\\n\\nThe highly polarised nature of the conflict often leads to conflicting narratives and interpretations of events. Further, investigations into these allegations are often hindered by limited access to conflict zones and lack of cooperation from both sides.\\n\\nIt is important to note that while the pervasive use of digital technologies exacerbates disinformation, it is by no means a product of information technology. False news predates the rise of the internet and the widespread use of digital platforms for news.\\n\\nFor instance, the news of Hamas harming babies is strikingly similar to the Gulf War reportage claiming that Iraqi soldiers had removed babies from incubators in Kuwait hospitals and left them to die. This story was widely reported and influenced public opinion, but it was later revealed to be a fabrication— part of a well-orchestrated propaganda campaign aimed at justifying military intervention.\\n\\nWhat is the impact of false information?\\n\\nIn the digital age, the menace of false information is pervasive and has become a pressing concern. False information, referred to as disinformation when intentional and misinformation when unintentional, has far-reaching consequences. It does not just shape public opinion and influence events such as elections but may also incite violence.\\n\\nThe 2018 ‘WhatsApp Lynchings’, where messages circulated on the popular messaging platform WhatsApp spread canards about child kidnappers operating in various parts of the country and led to a wave of panic and fear among the public, perfectly illustrate this phenonemon. Tragically, multiple people lost their lives as a result of mob attacks following the false rumours.\\n\\nSuch disinformation can include doctored images, videos and text messages, which may be designed to manipulate emotions and provoke a sense of urgency that leads to the rapid spread of false information.\\n\\nArguably, the perniciousness of fake news reached its zenith during the Covid pandemic, leading to an ‘infodemic’ due to the abundance of misinformation.\\n\\nIn the WhatsApp lynching case, the lack of verification and critical thinking, combined with the rapid spread of these messages, led to a dangerous situation where innocent lives were lost due to the dissemination of false information.\\n\\nArguably, the perniciousness of fake news reached its zenith during the Covid pandemic, leading to an ‘infodemic’ due to the abundance of misinformation. Among other things, this included false claims about unproven treatments or cures, as well as dangerous misleading information on self-medication.\\n\\nEven when lives are not at stake, the psychological impact of fake news can cause profound damage. Fake news often employs emotional manipulation techniques, such as using compelling narratives or evocative imagery, to elicit strong emotional responses.\\n\\nWhen individuals come across alarming or distressing headlines, it can trigger emotional responses such as fear, anger or anxiety, contributing to heightened stress levels that negatively impact mental health.\\n\\nAs individuals struggle to discern what is true and what is false, the constant exposure to misinformation can lead to a state of heightened vigilance and mistrust, contributing to a general sense of unease and anxiety in an already tense situation.\\n\\nWhat are Indian laws regarding fake news?\\n\\nIn India, fake news is regulated through a complex legal framework that covers cable TV, newspapers, online platforms and films that are used to handle cases such as the 2018 WhatsApp lynching incident.\\n\\nTo illustrate, the Supreme Court of India, in the case of Tehseen S. Poonawalla versus Union of India prescribed certain guidelines to state governments, including the registration of a first information report (FIR) “under Section 153A of the IPC and/or other relevant provisions of law, against persons who disseminate irresponsible and explosive messages and videos having content which is likely to incite mob violence and lynching of any kind.”\\n\\nThe Indian Penal Code (IPC) contains provisions that can be applied to cases involving fake news and misinformation. Sections such as 153 (provocation with intent to cause riot), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, etc.), and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) can be invoked to address instances where fake news leads to violence, communal disharmony or public disorder.\\n\\nThe Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 provides the legal framework for investigating and prosecuting criminal offences in India. It includes provisions that can be applied to cases involving fake news, such as the power to conduct searches, seize evidence and arrest individuals involved in disseminating false information.\\n\\nWhen individuals come across alarming or distressing headlines, it can trigger emotional responses such as fear, anger or anxiety, which contribute to heightened stress levels that negatively impacts mental health.\\n\\nMore recently, Section 195(d) of the proposed Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill, 2023, which was introduced in Lok Sabha in August to revamp Indian criminal laws, seeks to punish the spreading of fake news or misleading information that jeopardises the sovereignty and security of India with jail time of up to three years or a fine, or both.\\n\\nThe Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) includes provisions to address various cybercrimes. The dissemination of disinformation and misinformation is primarily dealt with under Section 79 of the IT Act.\\n\\nThe Section provides immunity to intermediaries, such as social media platforms, from liability for any third-party content hosted on their platforms. However, intermediaries are also required to comply with certain due diligence requirements, including taking down or restricting access to unlawful content upon receiving a court order or a government directive.\\n\\nThus, while the Section offers protection to intermediaries, it does not absolve them of their responsibility to address fake news. If an intermediary receives actual knowledge or is notified by the appropriate government agency about the presence of fake news on their platform, they are required to promptly remove or disable access to such content.\\n\\nIn recent years, the need for intermediary liability and regulations to address the spread of fake news has been highlighted. The Indian government aimed to hold intermediaries accountable for the dissemination of false information and proposed amendments to the IT Act to address this issue more effectively.\\n\\nThese developments culminated in the notification of the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (Rules) in February 2021. Although they do not directly address fake news, the Rules require online intermediaries and news publications to comply with certain baseline measures for addressing the issue of fake news and misinformation.\\n\\nHowever, due to the alleged draconian nature of the Rules, they are facing several legal challenges in Indian courts.\\n\\nOne problem is that the attempts by the government to regulate fake news, as exemplified by the amendment to the IT regulatory framework, have a tendency to make the government the sole arbiter of what is true and what is false. This is obviously problematic, particularly in democracies, because governments are run by political parties which have a vested interest to present one version of ‘the truth’ at the cost of others.\\n\\nThe Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act), includes provisions to address various cybercrimes. The dissemination of disinformation and misinformation is primarily dealt with under Section 79 of the IT Act.\\n\\nWhile the Indian government’s efforts to tackle fake news are commendable, several challenges persist. The sheer volume and speed at which misinformation spreads on social media platforms pose a significant challenge. The lack of awareness and media literacy among certain sections of society also hampers the effectiveness of these initiatives.\\n\\nImportantly, striking a balance between curbing fake news and protecting freedom of speech is a delicate task as government overreach may cause a chilling effect on free speech and much-needed critical journalism.\\n\\nWhat is the response of social media and online platforms?\\n\\nThe response of social media platforms to disinformation has been mixed at best. It involves measures such as implementing fact-checking systems to identify and label false or misleading information as well as to provide users with additional context while directing them to verified sources of information.\\n\\nApart from partnering with fact-checkers, online platforms also undertake content moderation and removal, as well as algorithmic adjustments to reduce the visibility of false or misleading content and promote reliable sources of information from trusted sources. User reporting and flagging also help platforms identify and review potentially problematic content more efficiently.\\n\\nFor instance, Google’s approach to fighting misinformation online involves teams of experts working to provide users with high-quality and trusted information, while also reducing the spread of harmful content. The company has implemented rules and policies across their services to prohibit certain types of misinformation.\\n\\nGoogle also collaborates with partners worldwide to counteract fake news and has signed agreements such as the European Union (EU) Code of Practice on Disinformation. The tech giant has also explored innovative approaches such as prebunking to build resilience against misleading narratives.\\n\\nWhile Google and other online platforms have been collectively called out by lawmakers from the EU and United States (US), X (formerly Twitter) seems to have emerged as the biggest loser in the war against disinformation.\\n\\nWhile Google and other online platforms have been collectively called out by lawmakers from the EU and the US, X seems to have emerged as the biggest loser in the war against disinformation.\\n\\nX has faced more controversy regarding its approach to fake news since Elon Musk took over the social media company. According to their website, X aims to create a safe and informed environment by taking various actions against misleading content.\\n\\nThey have separate policies for crisis misinformation, synthetic and manipulated media, and election integrity. Misleading content confirmed to be false or shared in a deceptive manner may be labelled, have reduced visibility, or be removed. X also takes actions to inform and contextualise by sharing information from third-party sources.\\n\\nThey may prompt users when engaging with misleading posts and launch pre-bunks during important events. X is also testing features for users to report misinformation and provide additional context through ‘community notes’.\\n\\nHowever, there has been a flood of disinformation and fake news on the platform, mainly related to the latest Israel–Palestine flare-up since the platform made changes that removed headlines while displaying articles and due to heavy layoffs in its ‘trust’ and ‘safety’ teams that oversee daily communications and mitigate the posting and spread of false content. These changes have raised concerns about X’s ability to provide reliable information.\\n\\nThe problem of disinformation through videos is not limited to pro-Israel propaganda. Last week, a viral video on X supposedly showed a Hamas fighter firing a shoulder-mounted rocket cannon and taking down an Israeli helicopter. Later, the footage was found to be from a video game called Arma 3. However, despite community notes pointing out its deceptive nature, the video is still up on multiple accounts on X, and even Facebook.\\n\\nWho watches disinformation from the watchdogs?\\n\\nBJP IT cell is known for its extensive use of social media platforms, including X, Facebook and WhatsApp, to promote the party’s agenda, counter opposition narratives, and mobilise support. Listed as the ‘IT, website and social media management’ department on the BJP website, it is often described as a well-organised strategic unit.\\n\\nMembers of the BJP IT cell are known for their active participation in online discussions, debates and campaigns. They often amplify the party’s messages, defend its leaders and policies, and disparage political opponents.\\n\\nThe problem of disinformation through videos is not limited to pro-Israel propaganda. Last week, a viral video on X supposedly showed a Hamas- armed fighter firing a shoulder-mounted rocket cannon and taking down an Israeli helicopter. Later, the footage was found to be from a video game called Arma 3.\\n\\nThe IT Cell is also involved in monitoring and responding to news articles, fact-checking the opposition party’s claims, and disseminating party-related information.\\n\\nIncreasingly, it is evident that some sections of the BJP, especially the BJP IT cell, have been involved in spreading misinformation, fake news and hate speech, although not all members of the BJP engage in such activities. For instance, a recent report found that 205 or 80 percent of the 255 documented anti-Muslim hate speech from gatherings in the first half of 2023 occurred in BJP-ruled states and Union territories.\\n\\nThis complicates an already divisive scenario, where sections of the political party in power may be actively involved in spreading disinformation about the ongoing Israel–Palestine flare-up.\\n\\nWhat are some solutions to combat fake news in situations of crisis?\\n\\nThe availability of real solutions seems to be at its nadir, considering the magnitude of disinformation and its deleterious effects. Moreover, it is increasingly evident that politicians and powerful technology companies may ultimately profit from fake news.\\n\\nVarious platforms such as news agencies and ChatGPT suggest that users take matters into their own hands and verify the authenticity of news.\\n\\nEstablishing fact-checking organisations specialising in verifying the accuracy of news stories. These include Snopes, FactCheck.org, and PolitiFact. Indian fact-checkers include boomlive.in and altnews.in. This should be a growing tribe.\\n\\nSome suggested measures include:\\n\\nCross-referencing multiple sources and using well-established news organisations with a track-record of reliable reporting. Evaluating the credibility of sources considering factors such as journalistic standards, editorial policies and history of accurate reporting while being cautious of sources known for spreading misinformation or having a clear bias. 3. Checking news articles for primary sources and citations that add credibility to news reports. Establishing fact-checking organisations specialising in verifying the accuracy of news stories. These include Snopes, FactCheck.org, and PolitiFact. Indian fact-checkers include boomlive.in and altnews.in. This should be a growing tribe. Being sceptical of sensational or clickbait headlines and reading articles fully and substantially to evaluate the content before accepting the headline as accurate. Considering the presence of bias and being cautious of sources that consistently present a one-sided or extreme viewpoint. Using critical thinking skills and looking for logical inconsistencies, unsupported claims or lack of evidence.\\n\\nAnother solution lies with relatively neutral truth-finding bodies such as the UN. Through the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, it included East Jerusalem Palestinians and Israelis undertaking an extensive investigation of “current events and identifying those responsible for violations of international law on all sides, both those directly committing international crimes and those in positions of command responsibility.”\\n\\nUndeniably, even if facts triumph over disinformation in this battle for truth, the Israel–Palestine crisis only seems to be worsening. Much like the fake news of beheaded babies, real children on both sides are its most tragic victims.\\n\\nPrachi Arya is a law and policy consultant, having worked with the tech industry for a decade',\n",

Mike Johnson as House speaker Wednesday, elevating a deeply conservative but lesser-known leader to the seat of U.S. power and ending for now the political chaos in their majority.\\n\\nJohnson of Louisiana swept on the first ballot with support from all Republicans anxious to put the past weeks of tumult behind and get on with the business of governing.\\n\\nA lower-ranked member of the House GOP leadership team, Johnson emerged as the fourth Republican nominee in what has become an almost absurd cycle of political infighting since Kevin McCarthy’s ouster as GOP factions jockey for power. While not the party’s top choice for the gavel, the deeply religious and even-keeled Johnson has few foes and an important GOP backer: Donald Trump.\\n\\n“I think he’s gonna be a fantastic speaker,” Trump said Wednesday at the New York courthouse where the former president, who is now the Republican front-runner for president in 2024, is on trial over a lawsuit alleging business fraud.\\n\\nREAD MORE: GOP loses 3rd House speaker nominee after pushback from Trump dooms Emmer’s bid\\n\\nTrump said he hadn’t heard “one negative comment about him. Everybody likes him.”\\n\\nThree weeks on without a House speaker, the Republicans have been wasting their majority status — a maddening embarrassment to some, democracy in action to others, but not at all how the House is expected to function.\\n\\nFar-right members have refused to accept a more traditional speaker, and moderate conservatives don’t want a hard-liner. While Johnson had no opponents during the private roll call late Tuesday, some two dozen Republicans did not vote, more than enough to sink his nomination.\\n\\nBut when GOP Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik rose to introduce Johnson’s name Wednesday as their nominee, Republicans jumped to their feet for an extended standing ovation.\\n\\n“House Republicans and Speaker Mike Johnson will never give up,” she said.\\n\\nDemocrats again nominated their leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, criticizing Johnson as an architect of Trump’s legal effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election he lost.\\n\\nWith Republicans controlling the House only 221-212 over Democrats, Johnson can afford just a few detractors to win the gavel.\\n\\nOvernight the endorsements for Johnson started pouring in, including from failed speaker hopefuls — Rep. Jim Jordan, the hard-charging Judiciary Committee chairman, gave his support, as did Majority Leader Steve Scalise, the fellow Louisiana congressman, who stood behind Johnson after he won the nomination.\\n\\n“Mike! Mike! Mike!” lawmakers chanted at a press conference after the late-night internal vote, surrounding Johnson and posing for selfies in a show of support.\\n\\nAnxious and exhausted, Republican lawmakers are desperately trying to move on.\\n\\nJohnson’s rise comes after a tumultuous month, capped by a head-spinning Tuesday that within a span of a few hours saw one candidate, Rep. Tom Emmer, the GOP Whip, nominated and then quickly withdraw when it became clear he would be the third candidate unable to secure enough support from GOP colleagues after Trump bashed his nomination.\\n\\n“He wasn’t MAGA,” said Trump, referring to his Make America Great Again campaign slogan.\\n\\nAttention quickly turned to Johnson. A lawyer specializing in constitutional issues, Johnson had rallied Republicans around Trump’s legal effort to overturn the 2020 election results.\\n\\nElevating Johnson to speaker would give Louisianians two high-ranking GOP leaders, putting him above Scalise, who was rejected by hard-liners in his own bid as speaker.\\n\\nDeeply religious, Johnson is affable and well liked, with a fiery belief system. Colleagues swiftly started giving their support.\\n\\n“Democracy is messy sometimes, but it is our system,” Johnson said after winning the nomination. “We’re going to restore your trust in what we do here.”\\n\\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who led a small band of hard-liners to engineer McCarthy’s ouster at the start of the month, posted on social media that “Mike Johnson won’t be the Speaker the Swamp wants but, he is the Speaker America needs.”\\n\\nRepublicans have been flailing all month, unable to conduct routine business as they fight amongst themselves with daunting challenges ahead.\\n\\nThe federal government risks a shutdown in a matter of weeks if Congress fails to pass funding legislation by a Nov. 17 deadline to keep services and offices running. More immediately, President Joe Biden has asked Congress to provide $105 billion in aid — to help Israel and Ukraine amid their wars and to shore up the U.S. border with Mexico. Federal aviation and farming programs face expiration without action.\\n\\nMany hard-liners have been resisting a leader who voted for the budget deal that McCarthy struck with Biden earlier this year, which set federal spending levels that far-right Republicans don’t agree with and now want to undo. They are pursuing steeper cuts to federal programs and services with next month’s funding deadline.\\n\\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said she wanted assurances the candidates would pursue impeachment inquiries into Biden and other top Cabinet officials.\\n\\nDuring the turmoil, the House is now led by a speaker pro tempore, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the bow tie-wearing chairman of the Financial Services Committee. His main job is to elect a more permanent speaker.\\n\\nSome Republicans — and Democrats — wanted to give McHenry more power to get on with the routine business of governing. But McHenry, the first person to be in the position that was created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks as an emergency measure, declined to back those overtures.

       " {'articleBody': 'Following the Palestinian militant organization Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7, the U.S. government acted swiftly to dissuade other regional actors such as Hizballah or Iran from intervening in the latest round of Israeli-Hamas hostilities. The attack killed over 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians, and resulted in another 3,500 wounded, 102 of them seriously. Hamas also took over 200 hostages, which included a number of foreigners, including 26 children. In response, Israel initiated Operation Iron Swords, and as of Oct. 19 the military campaign, according to the Palestinian Health Authority (independent figures are unavailable), has killed approximately 4,317 Palestinians and wounded over 13,000, most of whom are civilians. The scale and brutality of Hamas’ attack and the intensity of Israel’s response, which far exceeds previous rounds of fighting in Gaza, have set the region on edge and raised fears about a multi-front conflict and regional war, an outcome the United States is actively seeking to deter.\\n\\nIn his remarks on the attacks, President Joseph Biden was blunt: “Let me say again — to any country, any organization, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this situation, I have one word: Don’t. Don’t.” Backing up the president’s words, the Pentagon approved a deployment extension for the USS Gerald Ford carrier strike group in the eastern Mediterranean and redirected a second, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group, which is on a regularly scheduled deployment and is now headed to the Middle East. Additionally, reports suggest that the United States is preparing further naval reinforcements, including ships carrying upward of 2,400 Marines, as a potential rapid reaction force. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has indicated that the United States has conveyed its position to the government in Iran through diplomatic channels, and Western allies have also urged restraint in their own conversations with Iranian officials. Biden’s visit to Israel, an active war zone not controlled by the U.S. military, is somewhat unusual for an American president and represents a further effort at signaling to all the regional parties.\\n\\nAlthough the administration acknowledges the potential dangers of escalation, it is far from clear what might constitute potential triggers, much less U.S. responses or eventual endgames should deterrence fail. The potential for direct U.S. military involvement in a wider regional conflict is all too real, and an examination of the various vectors for potential escalation demonstrates how precarious the current moment is. Although Biden denied a report that the United States told Israel it would intervene in the event of a more serious conflict between Israel and Hizballah, other officials have carefully maintained ambiguity, whether as a further means of signaling deterrence or to keep open the underlying military option.\\n\\nThe Biden administration should prepare for the possibility that deterrence alone may not prevent a wider conflict potentially involving the United States. As U.S. domestic law is unlikely to prevent America sliding into war, potentially without congressional authorization, action needs to be taken now to forestall U.S. entry into yet another Middle East war and a wider, destabilizing conflict. The U.S. government should urge Israel to pause its air attacks, continue to work on facilitating the movement of humanitarian aid in Gaza, and delay a ground offensive that appears imminent. This should lead to negotiations on further hostage releases and a full ceasefire.\\n\\nA Regional Tinderbox\\n\\nShould Israel pursue its stated objective of “toppling Hamas and destroying its military capabilities” through a potentially protracted ground invasion of Gaza, with all the civilian death and destruction that would inevitably entail, Hizballah may well step up attacks against Israel in the north, potentially initiating a cycle of escalation that could lead to full-scale war. Alongside the fighting, the dire situation of civilians in Gaza is further compounded by the unfolding humanitarian crisis following Israel’s near-total blockade of Gaza, which has meant that no food, fuel, or electricity is currently flowing to the besieged enclave. While the Israeli government announced the resumption of water supplies through one pipe reaching south Gaza, humanitarian organizations operating in the area have emphasized that this supply was temporary and wholly inadequate when compared to the needs of the entirety of Gaza. Egypt has been keen to resume normal operations at the Rafah border crossing, fearful of the potential spillover into North Sinai. Border operations were hampered by Israeli military actions and declarations that made clear that humanitarian convoys would not be allowed into Gaza. Following his meetings in Israel, President Biden indicated that he had reached an agreement to allow for humanitarian supplies to reach Gaza through Rafah. Operations were delayed because of an impasse over inspection modalities and the scope of humanitarian operations, but began fitfully over the weekend, although no fuel was allowed in. But the flow of aid is far below pre-war levels and incommensurate with the massive and growing needs of Gaza’s populace.\\n\\nThe images of human suffering produced by this conflict have already captivated the Arab world’s attention and generated outrage at the plight of the Palestinians. That crisis is set to deepen and will exert its own pressure on Hizballah, potentially compelling it to go beyond the limited action it has undertaken so far. There is also the looming danger of mass displacement of Palestinians from Gaza into North Sinai. While Egypt and other regional parties have expressed their vehement opposition to such an outcome, seeing it as creating potentially irreversible new facts on the ground, the logic of the war may push events in that direction.\\n\\nAlongside the fighting in Gaza, the situation in the West Bank also represents an additional escalation point that could impact the perceptions and judgments of Hizballah and others. The West Bank has been the scene of increasing violence over the course of the past year, marked by escalating attacks by Israeli settlers, often backed by the state. That period represents the deadliest year in decades for West Bank Palestinians, and in the days following the Hamas attack, there has been yet another spike in such violence, with Israeli forces and settlers killing more than 90 Palestinians in the last two weeks.\\n\\nBut of course Hizballah and Israel are also locked in their own military conflict that has been contained by a fragile set of unwritten understandings that have come to define the rules of engagement between them. This modus vivendi has emerged through the periodic skirmishing that has defined this uneasy equilibrium since the ruinous 2006 war between the sides. So far these understandings about redlines that could trigger further escalation have held, but they are increasingly under pressure. Observers have largely assumed that mutual deterrence holds and that both Israel and Hizballah (and its external ally, Iran) seek to avoid a catastrophic repeat of the 2006 war, particularly in light of the current regional context and the possibilities for much wider and more protracted fighting this go-around. But these assumptions may be misplaced, and regardless of the intentions of the parties, misjudgments and mistakes may inadvertently draw them into conflict.\\n\\nRegional Escalation Dynamics\\n\\nEscalation in one locale may also trigger actions farther afield, such as in Iraq and Syria, where U.S. interests and personnel may come up against militia actors linked with Iran. Indeed, on Oct. 17 and 18, U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria were targeted with drones, piercing the relative lull of recent months. On Oct. 19, a U.S. Navy destroyer in the Red Sea intercepted several cruise missiles and drones launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen, another armed group allied with Iran, which the U.S. military believes may have been aimed at Israel.\\n\\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin recently acknowledged that deterrence would become more complicated as the fight in Gaza becomes more protracted and bloody. It would be a mistake to understand U.S. signaling through rhetoric and deeds as a symbolic gesture. For the Biden administration, whose senior national security officials are all veterans of the Barack Obama administration and participants in the redline incident in Syria, perceptions of U.S. credibility would likely be a major consideration shaping crisis response. It is not particularly difficult to imagine escalatory dynamics that could push the United States to actually use the warplanes aboard its aircraft carriers to strike at Hizballah.\\n\\nSetting aside the reputational costs of engaging in such a military endeavor, U.S. military action would likely pose a practical dilemma for U.S. policymakers, similar to what Israel is running up with against Hamas in Gaza: While much stronger than the Palestinian group, Hizballah is still operating as a militia, with no military infrastructure such as airfields and barracks or heavy equipment like tanks and battleships that airstrikes could target and destroy. Its strongest asset, up to 150,000 missiles and rockets — including an unknown number of precision-guided missiles that may be capable of wreaking massive damage on Israel’s infrastructure — are presumably embedded in residential areas. Taking out these weapons would require precise intelligence, but as is often the case, airstrikes in urban areas lead to widespread destruction and inevitable civilian casualties.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the very real risks, U.S. domestic law is unlikely to serve as a significant hurdle preventing the Biden administration from taking the United States to armed conflict once again in the Middle East. Enabling legal doctrines and self-judging lawyering within the executive branch provide the president substantial latitude to use military force without congressional authorization. And with passions understandably inflamed by Hamas’ unspeakable crimes, what many have dubbed “Israel’s 9/11”, Congress may be all too ready to give the executive branch whatever authorization it seeks.\\n\\nUnder the prevailing executive branch legal theories, the president has considerable discretion to use military force even without congressional authorization. According to the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel, whether the president may unilaterally use force depends on a two-part test — a test repeatedly invoked by administration witnesses during a recent congressional hearing on the use of force. The president must be able to establish, first, that the use of force serves a national interest, and second, that the nature, scope, and duration of the anticipated hostilities will not rise to the level of “war in the constitutional sense.”\\n\\nThe former prong, however, has been deemed to include everything from self-defense to regional stabilization, rendering it close to meaningless. Amongst the most obvious potential national interests the president might cite to justify the use of military force in the event of a large-scale Hizballah attack on Israel is the defense of U.S. nationals, given the presence of so many American citizens in Israel. Unsurprisingly, protection of U.S. nationals abroad has been the ostensible rationale for innumerable interventions over the last two centuries and indeed was part of the initial justification for the U.S. military campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\\n\\nThe latter test prong, which is a safeguard against unilateral military action that by its “nature, scope, and duration” implicates, in the executive branch’s view, Congress’s Article I war powers, should in principle be more constraining. The Office of Legal Counsel has identified one particularly salient factor in reviewing whether an anticipated military operation amounts to this level of “war in the constitutional sense:” the risk of escalation. In assessing the risk of escalation, the Office of Legal Counsel has considered whether U.S. forces would suffer or inflict substantial casualties and thus has looked closely at the presence of ground troops given “the difficulties of disengaging ground forces from situations of conflict, and the attendant risk that hostilities will escalate.”\\n\\nAlthough the Biden administration has been clear that it has no plans to put “boots on the ground” in Israel, there are thousands of U.S. troops deployed elsewhere in the region — including Iraq and Syria — subject to potential retaliation, if not directly from Hizballah or Iran themselves, then by other Iran-backed groups belonging to the so-called Axis of Resistance. The presence of such U.S. ground troops and the attendant risk of escalation against the United States should therefore weigh heavily in assessing whether U.S. intervention would constitute “war.”\\n\\nIn practice, however, this test has been applied unevenly by executive branch lawyers. Despite the risk to U.S. ground forces and likelihood of escalation, the Office of Legal Counsel blessed President Donald Trump’s killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, which predictably led to Iranian retaliation against U.S. troops through ballistic missile strikes on Al Asad airbase in Iraq.\\n\\nFurther, the statutory guardrail designed to prevent the president from taking the country to war unilaterally, the 1973 War Powers Resolution, has been largely gutted by aggressive executive branch interpretation, adverse court decisions, and congressional acquiescence. To be sure, the law still notionally requires the president to withdraw U.S. forces introduced into hostilities within 60 days, absent congressional authorization to continue fighting. But executive branch lawyers have read “hostilities” very narrowly — for example, not to include waves of combat sorties flown against targets in Libya in 2011 — and also showed a creative capacity to delay counting to 60, as they did during the Tanker Wars of the 1980s.\\n\\nMoreover, even if the White House conceded that congressional authorization to fight Hizballah was necessary or at least politically prudent, it is entirely possible that Congress would vote for such a war. Hawkish members of Congress were already discussing potential use of force authorizations against Iranian-backed groups even prior to Hamas’ massacre and kidnapping of civilians. Following the attack, the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Michael McCaul (R-TX), announced that he has been drafting an authorization possible targeting groups such as “Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran-backed Shi’ia militias.” The overwhelming majority of U.S. legislators have rallied around Israel following the attack, and further escalation between Hizballah and Israel would likely further reinforce support on Capitol Hill. Considering the emotions of this current post-9/11 moment, it is entirely conceivable that a majority in Congress would vote for such a measure.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe United States risks being drawn into an escalatory spiral in the Middle East. Domestic law will not prevent this. The best hope is diplomacy. The Biden administration should take further steps now to prevent the conflict in Gaza from widening. Recognizing that counsel of restraint will be unwelcome, the United States should nonetheless urge Israel to pause its air attacks, continue to work on facilitating the movement of humanitarian aid in Gaza, and delay a ground offensive that already appears to be in advanced stages of planning. At that point, talks on the release of all hostages could be given more time to succeed while also providing the parties an opportunity to begin framing the contours of a full ceasefire. This cannot be done without outside mediation, given the absence of direct contacts between Israel and Hamas. Qatar (which reportedly played a role in the release of two U.S. hostages) and Turkey, along with Egypt (which also has extensive experience in this regard), are obvious candidates to play this role.\\n\\nThe obvious counter to our argument is that the United States should not restrain Israel and that its own self-restraint when attacked by Iranian-backed groups invites more attack. However, dramatic actions to “restore deterrence,” such as the Trump administration’s strike on Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps leader Qasem Soleimani, led not to deterrence but to immediate escalation with Iran, through retaliation against U.S. personnel. We believe that while military force is a useful tool for diplomacy, it is not the only one. The costs of either Israel or the United States embarking on an expanded or new conflict with no clear or readily obtainable objective outweigh the likely security benefits. The collateral effects of such an endeavor would likely be severe in terms of civilian casualties, regional stability, and U.S. interests.\\n\\nThe failure to pause and instead proceed with a purely military solution could lead not only to a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and a dangerous, destabilizing escalation throughout the Middle East, but also to the United States once again going to war with no endgame. Secretary Austin recently invoked the post-9/11 lesson that “you have to really think through next steps. … Don’t operate on reflex activity. Think through what you’re going to do, what implications it’s going to have for the country, for the region and beyond.” This is sound advice, and the Biden administration should follow its own admonitions. The White House needs to think now about how to prevent a worsening war in Gaza that draws Hizballah and even the United States into armed conflict. Military deterrence alone may prove insufficient.\\n\\nBrian Finucane (@BCFinucane) is senior adviser with the U.S. Program at the International Crisis Group.

Full stop.\"\\n\\nHe did not mention the Palestinian people.\\n\\nAddressing reporters before departing for the Middle East on Oct. 11, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the top objective of his trip was a robust show of solidarity with Israel, including providing all the military equipment that it needs to defend itself.\\n\\n\"The United States has Israel\\'s back,\" Blinken said. He didn\\'t mention humanitarian aid at all.\\n\\nDuring Blinken\\'s six-day trip, the death toll in Gaza soared from Israeli air strikes and concerns grew about food and water. Every Arab leader Blinken met in the region pressed him to urgently find a solution to the rapidly deteriorating situation in Gaza.\\n\\nBlinken relayed the concerns of Arab leaders, while others spoke to the U.S. president directly.\\n\\nThe intense protests against Israel that followed last week\\'s blast at a Palestinian hospital, which the United States and Israel both blamed on Palestinian militants, also alarmed U.S. officials.\\n\\nThe protests were reminders of the risks of escalation during any ground assault, U.S. officials said, because they show how Israel\\'s adversaries could seek to wield disinformation to spark unrest.\\n\\nHUMANITARIAN PAUSE\\n\\nThe most rapid shift in U.S. policy has happened this week, to support a cessation in Israel\\'s attacks on Gaza to allow aid in and people to escape.\\n\\nAsked on Oct. 23 about international demands for a humanitarian pause, White House security spokesman John Kirby said the United States wants to make sure \"Israel has the tools it needs to defend itself and to go after Hamas and that humanitarian assistance keeps flowing.\"\\n\\nA day later, Kirby and Blinken advocated for one publicly. The shift followed a plea from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for civilians to be protected and increasingly desperate appeals from U.N. organizations to allow in aid.\\n\\nThe U.S. revised its own U.N. resolution from a focus on Israel\\'s right to defend itself to include calls for all measures, specifically to include humanitarian pauses, to allow unhindered humanitarian access of aid.\\n\\nRemarks made by Biden on Wednesday are in contrast with those on Oct. 7, and show a new direction. \"Israel has to do everything in its power, as difficult as it is, to protect innocent civilians,\" Biden told a press conference.\\n\\nHe offered a rare criticism as well of Israel\\'s \"extremist settlers\" on the West Bank, accusing them of pouring gasoline on a fire, and called for a “concentrated effort,” once the crisis is over, to work toward an accord under which Israel and a new Palestinian state would exist side-by-side in peace.\\n\\nBut Biden also expressed skepticism toward Palestinian estimates of the death toll and a continued staunch support of Israel. He told the press conference that he had \"no confidence\" in the numbers the Palestinians were using about Gaza\\'s dead.\\n\\nReporting By Steve Holland, Phil Stewart, Matt Spetalnick, Humeyra Pamuk, Trevor Hunnicutt and Michelle Nichols.

These actions were taken in response to an attack launched by the Hamas group on October 7. In a statement posted on X, the Israeli Air Force stated, “Throughout the night, the IDF conducted strikes on more than a hundred operational sites belonging to various terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip, resulting in the elimination of a terrorist involved in the recent violent activities in the Gaza Strip.”\\n\\nThe Israel Air Force reported that during the operation, Israeli fighter jets successfully targeted and destroyed tunnel entrances, munition depots, and multiple operational command centers. They also reported that a mosque in the Jablia neighborhood, which was being used as an observation post and a gathering point for terrorists associated with Hamas, was among the locations where terrorist infrastructure and weapons were destroyed.\\n\\nAdditionally, the IDF and Shin Bet announced the elimination of a Hamas Naval force terrorist who had been responsible for violent activities in the Gaza Strip. According to the IDF, “In the course of these operations, a terrorist from the naval force of the Hamas terrorist organization, who had been involved in violent activities in the Gaza Strip, was eliminated. Furthermore, a targeted attack prevented a terrorist squad affiliated with the terrorist organization’s air force from launching missiles at an aircraft.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, senior Israeli officials have discussed the possibility of a large-scale ground operation in the Gaza Strip to dismantle the Hamas terrorist group, as reported by The Times of Israel. Israel’s Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, conveyed to soldiers near Gaza that the order to enter the Palestinian enclave would be issued “soon.” He encouraged them by saying, “You now see Gaza from a distance, but soon you will see it up close.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also visited the frontline, addressing a group of Golani soldiers near the Gaza border and expressing confidence in a major victory.\\n\\nIn addition to these developments, the Defense Ministry and the Israel Defense Forces announced plans to relocate residents from the northern city of Kiryat Shmona to government-subsidized accommodations. This move comes in response to repeated rocket and missile attacks by the Hezbollah terror group and other Palestinian factions allied with them, which have been targeting northern Israel.\\n\\nAlso Read: PM Modi Inaugurates Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut RRTS Corridor Priority Section\\n\\nCatch all the Latest Business News, Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on NewsX',\n",

China vetoed the draft resolution, pointing out that the draft is seriously out of balance and confuses right and wrong. Photo: Xinhua\\n\\nA US-backed draft resolution on the Israel-Hamas conflict was vetoed for it did not reflect the world\\'s strongest calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, showing that the deadlock is deepening at the UN Security Council (UNSC) after several relevant drafts on the issue failed to pass in recent weeks. Some observers saw Washington as playing a proxy role for Israel, with an apparent long-term biased view at the UNSC, impeding efforts to tackle the Israel-Palestine issue.The resolution drafted by the US would have reaffirmed Israel\\'s right to self-defense, urged respect for international laws — especially protection of civilians — and called for \"humanitarian pauses\" to deliver desperately needed aid to Gaza, the AP reported on Thursday.In Wednesday\\'s vote in the 15-member council, 10 countries voted in favor, Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates voted against. The resolution was not adopted because permanent council members Russia and China cast vetoes.The draft is seriously out of balance and confuses right and wrong, was introduced in haste and lacked the consensus it deserved, Zhang Jun, China\\'s permanent representative to the UN, said in an explanation of the vote.It does not reflect the world\\'s strongest calls for a ceasefire and an end to the fighting, and it does not help resolve the issue, Zhang said.The initial US text shocked many diplomats with its bluntness in stating Israel has a right to defend itself and demanding that Iran stop exporting arms to militant groups, Reuters said. It did not include a call for humanitarian pauses for aid access, according to the media report.After the failure of the US resolution, the UNSC voted on a Russian-drafted text that called for a humanitarian ceasefire and withdrawal of Israel\\'s order for civilians in Gaza to relocate south ahead of a ground assault, Al Jazeera reported on Thursday.This was the second draft resolution led by Russia in two weeks, but was not adopted as it failed to secure the sufficient number of votes in favor.Earlier last week, a Brazil-led draft resolution calling for humanitarian pauses for full and unhindered aid into Gaza, condemnation of violence against all civilians and rescission of Israel\\'s evacuation order failed to be adopted due to a veto by the US.There\\'s a long history of divergences at the UN on the Palestine issue. The US has vetoed a number of resolutions in the past concerning Israeli occupation of some Palestinian territory or Israel\\'s massive retaliation that caused humanitarian crisis, Li Weijian, a research fellow with the Institute for Foreign Policy Studies of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday.\"Such divergences delayed the resolution of the Israel-Palestine issue, which also impeded the UN from playing its normal role,\" Li said, noting that the US veto of the Russia-led resolution came out of intensifying geopolitical confrontation.Israeli ground forces operated within the northern Gaza Strip on Thursday, attacking multiple Hamas targets before withdrawing, Reuters reported.Given the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, European Union leaders will call for the establishment of \"humanitarian corridors and pauses\" to get urgently-needed aid into Gaza at a summit in Brussels on Thursday, the media report said.A video showing Wael Al Dahdouh, a journalist from the Al Jazeera, who lost his wife, son, daughter, and grandson in a reported Israeli airstrike on Wednesday, was circulating on Chinese social media on Thursday, grabbing the public\\'s attention on how severe the humanitarian crisis is now in Gaza.The Gaza conflict has gone through two stages, firstly the attack by Hamas on Israelis, and second Israel\\'s bombing of Gaza, but the US-led resolution mainly focused on Israel\\'s \"right of self-defense,\" Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Thursday.In explaining China\\'s veto on the US-led resolution, Zhang said the draft resolution attempts to establish a new narrative on the Palestine question, ignoring the fact that the Palestinian territory has been occupied for a long time and evading the fundamental issue of independent statehood for the Palestinian people.\"It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum,\" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said recently, who also accused Israel of clear violations of humanitarian law in the Gaza Strip.\"The UNSC is now in an awkward position as it\\'s difficult for the five permanent members of the UNSC to achieve an agreement now. The US is playing the role of a proxy for Israel by only repeating its stances,\" Liu said, noting that this kind of bloc confrontation will dodge some key issues and prolong the Israel-Palestine conflict.The top priority on the Palestine-Israel issue is to cease fire, avoid humanitarian disasters, downgrade conflicts, and allow the UN to play its due role, Special Envoy of the Chinese Government on the Middle East Issue Zhai Jun told a symposium on the Arab-Chinese Relations and Dialogue between Arab and Chinese Civilizations recently.The solution to the Palestinian issue is a two-state solution, which is to establish an independent Palestinian state and achieve peaceful coexistence between the Palestinians and Israel. The right way to advance the two-country plan is to resume peace talks as soon as possible and allow various peace mechanisms to play a positive role, Zhai said.China\\'s position is based on facts and justice, responding to the strong appeal of the international community, especially the Arab countries, Mao Ning, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a press conference on Thursday.China has no selfish interests on the Palestinian question. China will firmly support anything conducive to peace, and will exert its utmost to do anything conducive to the reconciliation between Palestine and Israel, she said.On Thursday, the China International Development Cooperation Agency announced it would provide another 15 million yuan ($2.05 million) in emergency humanitarian supplies to the Gaza Strip to help those affected by the conflict, given the deteriorating humanitarian situation. The Chinese government recently provided $1 million in cash assistance through the Palestinian National Authority and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East.Experts said there is still a possibility for a ceasefire, especially with the US and Israel facing pressure globally and domestically, which will force Washington to exert some influence on Israel.\"Supporting Israel is the politically correct stance in the US, especially as the Biden administration is also facing pressure from pro-Israel Republicans as elections loom, so it has to demonstrate its firm support,\" Li said.But as the conflict continues, the US needs to consider the international pressure that Israel is facing and how it will interact with Arab countries in the future, which could provide some possibilities for a future ceasefire when Israel\\'s stated targets are reached, he added.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': \"Several US states are concerned that the mental health of its young users are under threat from social media platforms. Over 40 US states have sued Meta for platforms like Facebook and Instagram. They claim that the social media company is knowingly and deliberately hurting the mental condition of children. The platforms, owned by Meta, have been accused of designing features that could potentially harm children’s mental health.\\n\\nAccording to the complainants, “Meta has harnessed powerful and unprecedented technologies to entice, engage, and ultimately ensnare youth and teens. Its motive is profit, and in seeking to maximize its financial gains, Meta has repeatedly misled the public about the substantial dangers of its social media platforms,” the complaint says. “It has concealed the ways in which these platforms exploit and manipulate its most vulnerable consumers: teenagers and children.”\\n\\nThe lawsuit further claims that “Kids and teenagers are suffering from record levels of poor mental health and social media companies like Meta are to blame,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James in a statement. “Meta has profited from children’s pain by intentionally designing its platforms with manipulative features that make children addicted to their platforms while lowering their self-esteem.”\\n\\nMeta responded to the accusations by claiming that it is disappointed with the case. In a statement it said that it is on the side of the attorney generals who have formulated the case against Meta’s Instagram and Facebook. To justify that, Meta has claimed it has introduced over 30 tools just to support teens and families.\\n\\nMeta stated, “We’re disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorney generals have chosen this path.”\\n\\nBut what does the research say?\\n\\nA study conducted at the University of Pennsylvania found that high usage of Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram increases feelings of loneliness. The research suggests that limiting social media usage to around 30 minutes a day can lead to significant improvement in well-being.\\n\\nIn September 2021, a report by the Wall Street Journal leaked an internal document authored by Facebook’s own researchers. In the presentation, they acknowledged that Instagram can make teenagers feel worse about their bodies. In fact, “32% of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.” One of its internal studies found that 13.5% of teen girls said Instagram made suicidal thoughts worse, and 17% of teen girls said it made eating disorders worse.\\n\\nA US state has a unique solution to this problem. Utah became the first US state to require social media firms to get parental consent for children to use their apps and verify users are at least 18. The state has also imposed a social media curfew that blocks children’s access between 22:30 and 06:30 unless adjusted by their parents.\\n\\nHow can you protect kids and teens from the ill effects of Social Media?\\n\\nThere are steps you can take to encourage responsible use of social media and limit some of its negative effects. Consider these tips:\\n\\nSet reasonable limits: Talk to your teen about how to avoid letting social media interfere with his or her activities, sleep, meals or homework. Encourage a bedtime routine that avoids electronic media use, and keep smartphones and tablets out of teens' bedrooms. Set an example by following these rules yourself.\\n\\nMonitor your teen's accounts: Let your teen know that you'll be regularly checking his or her social media accounts. You might aim to do so once a week or more. Make sure you follow through.\\n\\nExplain what's not OK: Discourage your teen from gossiping, spreading rumors, bullying or damaging someone's reputation — online or otherwise. Talk to your teen about what is appropriate and safe to share on social media.\\n\\nEncourage face-to-face contact with friends: This is particularly important for teens vulnerable to social anxiety disorder.\\n\\nTalk about social media: Talk about your own social media habits. Ask your teen how he or she is using social media and how it makes him or her feel. Remind your teen that social media is full of unrealistic images.\\n\\nAlso read: Meta, Google pull out of Lisbon tech summit over organiser's comments on Israel\\n\\nAlso read: WhatsApp's India dilemma: Massive userbase but struggling revenue; what can Meta do?\",\n",

Stefanik highlighted how Johnson has dedicated his life to preserving America's great principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, principles that Johnson will not stop fighting for as Speaker of the People's House.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nView the full transcript of her remarks below:\\n\\n“Mr. Speaker Pro Temp, Madam Clerk, colleagues, on behalf of the House Republican Conference, I rise today to nominate the gentleman from Louisiana, Mike Johnson, as Speaker of The People's House.\\n\\nWe convene this esteemed body today at a time of great crisis across America, a time of unprecedented challenges in this hallowed Chamber, and a time when our most precious ally Israel's very existence is under attack from forces of evil.\\n\\nYesterday, our dear colleague, our former Conference Chair, our Chair of Energy and Commerce Cathy McMorris Rodgers nominated Mike Johnson in our Conference, and she put it best and I want to quote her today.\\n\\nShe said, quote, ‘Trust has been broken and we have come to a standstill. How do we restore trust between Members, leadership, and ultimately, between Congress and We The People?’\\n\\nCathy went on to say, ‘There's a sense that it cannot be business as usual.’ She went on to note, ‘Above the Speaker's chair in the House chamber is our nation's motto: In God We Trust!’ Ms. McMorris Rodgers went on to say, ‘The times in which we are living demand boldness...unity...and transformational leadership - that begins with trust in God and each other.’ Trust is when the magic happens. In the story of King David, we are reminded that man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.’ End quote.\\n\\nToday is the day that House Republicans will humbly look in our hearts and elect Mike Johnson as Speaker of the People's House. A man of deep faith, Mike epitomizes what it means to be a servant leader. A deeply respected Constitutional lawyer, Mike has dedicated his life to preserving America's great principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\\n\\nMike is a titan on the Judiciary Committee and a dedicated Member of the House Armed Services Committee. And as Vice Chair of our Conference, he has united all of our Members to speak clearly and boldly on behalf of the American people. A friend to all and an enemy to none, Mike is strong, tough, and fair, and above all, Mike is kind.\\n\\nAnd at this very moment, this Republican Conference knows that we live in perilous times, and the American people are hurting. Families are struggling under the pain of inflation caused by reckless Far Left spending - unable to afford groceries, heat, or gas. We have an inhumane open border with millions illegally smuggled and trafficked and tens of thousands of children lost in the chasm of the incompetence and negligence of the Biden Administration. Israel is under attack by Iranian backed Hamas terrorists committing atrocities with Israelis suffering the bloodiest days in modern memory. Crime is skyrocketing on our streets while there are vicious calls from the Left to defund our great men and women in blue. American energy production has been crushed by Joe Biden's radical, failed Far Left Democrat policies causing seniors, farmers, and families to pay more at the pump.\\n\\nAnd Americans fundamentally understand that the federal government has been illegally weaponized against We The People, shredding the Constitution, targeting conservatives, parents. Yes, I’ll say it again. The federal government has been illegally weaponized against We The People, shredding the Constitution, targeting conservatives, parents and even Joe Biden's top political opponent.\\n\\nThe People are looking to this great Chamber to save America. And save America, we will.\\n\\nAnd as we embark on the path ahead, I am reminded of Galatians 6:9: ‘And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season, we will reap if we do not give up.’\\n\\nHouse Republicans and Speaker Mike Johnson will never give up. Today is the day we get this done. May God Bless our Next Speaker, Mike Johnson. May God Bless the United States of America and I yield back.”\\n\\n###\",\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Israeli troops and tanks launched a brief ground raid into northern Gaza overnight into Thursday, the military said, striking several militant targets in order to “prepare the battlefield\" ahead of a widely expected ground invasion after more than two weeks of devastating air raids. Israeli armoured vehicles take part in an operation, as the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues, at a location given as the northern Gaza Strip(via REUTERS)\\n\\nThe raid came after the UN warned it is on the verge of running out of fuel in the Gaza Strip, forcing it to sharply curtail relief efforts in the territory, which has also been under a complete siege since Hamas\\' bloody rampage across southern Israel ignited the war earlier this month.\\n\\nHospitals in Gaza struggled to treat masses of wounded with dwindling resources. Health officials said the death toll was soaring as Israeli jets pounded Gaza. Workers pulled dead and wounded civilians, including many children, out of landscapes of rubble in cities across the territory.\\n\\nGaza\\'s Health Ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, said Wednesday that more than 750 people were killed over the past 24 hours, higher than the 704 killed the previous day. The Associated Press could not independently verify the death toll, and the ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.\\n\\nThe Israeli military, which accuses Hamas of operating among civilians, said its strikes killed militants and destroyed military targets. Gaza militants have fired unrelenting rocket barrages into Israel since the conflict started.\\n\\nDuring the overnight raid, the military said soldiers struck fighters, militant infrastructure and anti-tank missile launching positions. There were no immediate reports of casualties on either aide.\\n\\nThe rising death tolls in Gaza are unprecedented in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Even greater loss of life could come if Israel launches an expected ground offensive aimed at crushing Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007 and survived four previous wars with Israel.\\n\\nThe Gaza Health Ministry says more than 6,500 Palestinians have been killed in the war. That figure includes the disputed toll from an explosion at a hospital last week.\\n\\nThe fighting has killed more than 1,400 people in Israel, mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack, according to the Israeli government. Hamas also holds some 222 hostages in Gaza.\\n\\nThe warning by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, over depleting fuel supplies raised alarm that the humanitarian crisis could quickly worsen.\\n\\nGaza\\'s population has also been running out of food, water and medicine. About 1.4 million of Gaza\\'s 2.3 million residents have fled their homes, with nearly half of them crowded into U.N. shelters.\\n\\nIn recent days, Israel let a small number of trucks with aid enter from Egypt but barred deliveries of fuel — needed to power generators — saying it believes Hamas will take it.\\n\\nUNRWA has been sharing its own fuel supplies so that trucks can distribute aid, bakeries can feed people in shelters, water can be desalinated, and hospitals can keep incubators, life support machines and other vital equipment working.\\n\\nIf it continues doing all of that, fuel will run out by Thursday, so the agency is deciding how to ration its supply, UNRWA spokeswoman Tamara Alrifai told The Associated Press.\\n\\n“Do we give for the incubators or the bakeries?” she said. “It is an excruciating decision.”\\n\\nMore than half of Gaza\\'s primary health care facilities and roughly a third of its hospitals have stopped functioning, the World Health Organization said.\\n\\nAt Gaza City\\'s al-Shifa Hospital, the lack of medicine and clean water have led to “alarming” infection rates, the group Doctors Without Borders said. Amputations are often required to prevent infection from spreading in the wounded, it said.\\n\\nOne surgeon with the group described amputating half the foot of a 9-year-old boy with only “slight sedation” on a hallway floor as his mother and sister watched.\\n\\nThe conflict has also threatened to spread across the region. The Israeli military said it struck military sites in Syria in response to rocket launches from the country. Syrian state media said eight soldiers were killed and seven wounded.\\n\\nStrikes in Syria also hit the airports of Aleppo and Damascus, in an apparent attempt to prevent arms shipments from Iran to militant groups, including Lebanon\\'s Hezbollah. Israel has been exchanging near daily fire with Iranian-backed Hezbollah across the Lebanese border.\\n\\nHamas\\' surprise rampage on Oct. 7 in southern Israel stunned the country with its brutality, its unprecedented toll and the failure of intelligence agencies to know it was coming. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech Wednesday night that he will be held accountable, but only after Hamas was defeated.\\n\\n“We will get to the bottom of what happened,\" he said. \"This debacle will be investigated. Everyone will have to give answers, including me.”\\n\\nIsrael\\'s U.N. ambassador, Gilad Erdan, said his country will stop issuing visas to U.N. personnel after U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that Hamas\\' attack “did not happen in a vacuum.” It was unclear what the action, if implemented, would mean for U.N. aid personnel working in Gaza and the West Bank.\\n\\n“It\\'s time to teach them a lesson,” Erdan told Army Radio, accusing the U.N. chief of justifying a slaughter.\\n\\nThe U.N. chief told the Security Council on Tuesday that “the Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation.” Guterres said “the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.”\\n\\nGuterres said Wednesday he is “shocked” at the misinterpretation of his statement “as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas.”\\n\\n“This is false. It was the opposite,” he told reporters.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Bella Hadid has issued a heartbreaking statement online amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, saying that Palestine \"cannot afford our silence\".\\n\\nThe 27-year-old model asked her 60.5 million followers to \"forgive\" her for her silence, after receiving \"hundreds of death threats daily\" when her phone number was leaked, leaving her family feeling in danger.\\n\\n\"I can not be silenced any longer,\" she wrote. \"Fear is not an option. The people and children of Palestine, especially in Gaza, cannot afford our silence. We are not brave - they are.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSpeaking about the aftermath of the airstrikes in Gaza, Hadid said her \"heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood.\"\\n\\nThe model, of Dutch and Palestinian descent, continued: \"I mourn with all the mothers who have lost children and the children who cry alone, all the lost fathers, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunties, friends that will never again walk this earth.\"\\n\\nShe went on to highlight her own family\\'s history, with her father and grandparents being \"expelled\" from their homes in Palestine just nine days after his birth. This happened the same year as the Nakba in 1948, which saw over 700,000 Palestinian Arabs flee and be expelled from their homes. Before the Nakba, the UN noted that Palestine was a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural society.\\n\\nThe result of the war forced more than half of the Palestinian population to be displaced. The UN General Assembly called for refugee \"return, property restitution and compensation,\" however 75 years later, despite countless UN resolutions, \"the rights of the Palestinians continue to be denied.\"\\n\\nIn the Instagram post, Hadid candidly shared: \"My family witnessed 75 years of violence against Palestinian people - most notably, brutal settler invasions which led to the destruction of entire communities, murder in cold blood and the forcible removal of families from their homes. The practice of settlements on Palestinian land still continues to this day. The pain of that is unimaginable.\"\\n\\nBella Hadid/Instagram\\n\\nUltimately, Hadid called for \"humanity and compassion\" and for people to \"keep pressure on our leaders, wherever we are.\"\\n\\n\"I stand with humanity, knowing that peace and safety belong to us all,\" she concluded.\\n\\nThousands flocked to the post to praise the model for using her platform to raise awareness, with her mother Yolanda Hadid writing: \"Brave, honest and from the heart, I love you.\"\\n\\nAnother wrote: \"I love you.

You can\\'t appease evil.\"\\n\\nThe 46-year-old New York businessman decided to become a street activist. Along with his wife Tami, their 9-year-old son Eitan and 21- year-old daughter Maya, the family set out and canvassed local businesses to put up the posters of the missing in the shop windows along the commercial strip that encompasses several towns on New York\\'s Long Island. He said that he was met with wide-ranging support from more than 100 merchants who readily displayed the poignant and heartbreaking posters in their front windows.\\n\\n\"This goes to the basis of humanity. I am thinking of my own children. I was seeing pictures of the hostages, kids who don\\'t have their parents, a 4-year-old child being held hostage, who doesn\\'t have his parents, babies in cages in Gaza. I was hoping to come up with something that I could do for them.\"\\n\\nTsadik found the website of the two Israeli artists from New York who have designed the posters, KidnappedfromIsrael.com. He downloaded the link at a local printer store and printed out a heavy stack of posters for his project. Mindful of the anti-Israel protesters who have gone around and torn down the hostage photos elsewhere, he prevailed on shop owners to tape his posters inside their windows.\\n\\n\"I made sure that they were put inside of the stores, and not outside of the stores so that they couldn\\'t be torn down. These people who are tearing them down would be the very same people, if they were in Gaza, they would be executed in a dark alley,\" he said.\\n\\n\"They are misinformed or completely evil. The fact that they do not have compassion for innocent civilians, is beyond the pale. They are justifying these crimes against humanity, while in Israeli hospitals the murderers and terrorists are being treated side by side. The perpetrators and the victims are in adjoining rooms.\"\\n\\nFox News\\' Eric Shawn contributed to this update.',\n",

But Israel\\'s conflict with Hamas, which erupted following an attack by Hamas against Israeli civilians, has seen global attention switch to the Middle East. That has led to fears in Ukraine and amongst diplomats that military aid could be reduced or halted as the U.S. and other Western nations divert their resources towards the Israeli conflict. The EU\\'s two-day meeting will run through plans to deliver multi-year funding for Ukraine, including $52.6 billion in financial aid and up to $21 billion in military aid, though they won\\'t be able to officially sign off that package until the end of the year as the money is part of a wider funding battle. Before heading to Brussels on Thursday, Fico, a three-time prime minister last in power in 2018, and appointed for a fourth time as prime minister on Wednesday, told a parliamentary committee he would not support military aid for Ukraine, according to Slovak news website Dennik N.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"We all see there is no military solution,\" Fico was quoted as saying.\\n\\nFico is attending a two-day European Union summit on Thursday and Friday that will discuss a multi-year financial and military aid plan for Ukraine. /Yves Herman/Reuters Fico is attending a two-day European Union summit on Thursday and Friday that will discuss a multi-year financial and military aid plan for Ukraine. /Yves Herman/Reuters\\n\\nOn sanctions against Russia, Fico said he would not vote for any new measures until he assessed their impact on Slovakia, Dennik N and and the Pravda newspaper\\'s website reported. Previous Slovakian governments have shipped military hardware including fighter jets, an S-300 air defense system, and fighting and de-mining vehicles to Ukraine. Fico has said he supports humanitarian and reconstruction efforts, and backed peace talks for Ukraine as it battles Russia\\'s attack – a line similar to that of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban but rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies, who say this would only encourage Russian aggression.\\n\\nSubscribe to Storyboard: A weekly newsletter bringing you the best of CGTN every Friday\\n\\nSource(s): Reuters',\n",

The indian economy is predicted to suffer greatly in the event of World war Three as it would need to supply food, medicine, and weaponry to israel in order to keep bilateral relations intact. Furthermore, the indian economy would be severely damaged by the general increase in global inflation and crude oil prices, which will result in record-high gasoline costs and a shortage of essential goods.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

I call on him to resign immediately.\"\\n\\n\"There is no justification or point in talking to those who show compassion for the most terrible atrocities committed against the citizens of Israel and the Jewish people. There are simply no words,\" the envoy continued.\\n\\nIn an earlier post, Erdan alleged that Guterres was \"completely disconnected\" from the reality in Israel and that the UN chief viewed the attacks by Hamas in a \"distorted and immoral manner\".\\n\\n\"His statement that, “the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum,” expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder. It’s really unfathomable. It’s truly sad that the head of an organization that arose after the Holocaust holds such horrible views. A tragedy!\" Erdan added.\\n\\nAfter Erdan\\'s post, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said that he would not meet with Guterres on the sidelines of the UN Security Council meeting. \"I will not meet with the UN Secretary-General. After the October 7th massacre, there is no place for a balanced approach. Hamas must be erased off the face of the planet!\" he said on X.\\n\\nAddressing the UN Security Council session on the Israel-Gaza crisis, Cohen said, \"Mr Secretary General (Guterres), in what world do you live? Definitely, this is not our world\".\\n\\nReiterating Israel\\'s stance to vanquish the militant organisation, the Israeli Foreign Minister said that the only \"proportional response\" to Hamas attacks is the \"total destruction\" of the group.\\n\\n\"This is the world we live Secretary General. We gave Palestinians Gaza till the last millimetre. There is no dispute to the length of Gaza, but they take the money from the world and instead of building hospital, office buildings...they built tunnels to dug tunnels to build rocket factory,\" Cohen said.\\n\\nWhat did Guterres say?\\n\\nAccording to BBC, Guterres came out in support of Palestine at a meeting of the UNSC on Tuesday and said that the brutal Hamas attack on October 7 \"did not happen in a vacuum\".\\n\\n\"The Palestinian people been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. They have seen their lands steadily devolved by settlements and plagued by violence. Their economy stifled. Their people displaced and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing,\" he said at the UNSC meeting.\\n\\nGuterres said that the protection of civilians is paramount and expressed concern about \"clear violations of international humanitarian law\" in Gaza, without mentioning either Hamas or Israel by name. However, he also said that the situation in Palestine does not justify the Hamas attack and \"those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people\".\\n\\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged member-states of the UN to not \"throw fuel on the fire\" and send a united message to stop other countries from further exacerbating the Israel-Hamas conflict.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\"All acts of terrorism are unlawful and unjustifiable. Whether they target people in Nairobi or Bali, in Mumbai, New York or Kibbutz Be\\'eri...They\\'re unlawful and unjustifiable whether they\\'re carried out by ISIS, by Boko Haram, by Lashkar E Taiba, or by Hamas,\" Blinken said, adding that at least 33 American citizens have been killed in the conflict.\\n\\n\"This council has a responsibility to denounce member states that arm, fund and train Hamas or any other terrorist group that carries out such horrific acts,\" Blinken further said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe worsening situation in Gaza\\n\\nThe Hamas attack on October 7 killed 1,400 people, following which Israel unleashed relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip in their attempts to root out and kill Hamas militants. According to Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki, over 5,700 Palestinians have been killed, including 2,300 children and 1,300 women.\\n\\n\"More injustice and more killing will not make Israel safer. No amount of weapons, no alliance will bring to its security. Only peace will, peace with Palestine and its people. Our freedom is the condition of shared peace and security...It must be clear that this can only be achieved by putting an immediate end to the Israeli war launched against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,\" he said in the UNSC meeting.\\n\\nThe Hamas-run Health Ministry said that Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip have killed at least 704 people in the past day, representing a massive increase in the death count. Over 16,000 people have been wounded.\\n\\nGaza’s 2.3 million people have been running out of food, water and medicine since Israel sealed off the territory following the attack by Hamas. An expected ground offensive in Gaza is believed to have even more devastating humanitarian consequences.\\n\\nIsrael on Tuesday said that it had launched 400 airstrikes over the past day, killing Hamas commanders, hitting militants as they were preparing to launch rockets into Israel and striking command centers and a Hamas tunnel shaft. The previous day, Israel reported 320 strikes.\\n\\nOne overnight strike leveled a four-story residential building in the southern city of Khan Younis, killing at least 32 people and wounding dozens of others, according to survivors.\\n\\nHamas militants have released two Israeli hostages out of the 222 captives abducted on October 7. According to a report by the Jerusalem Post, the two women were identified as Nurit Cooper, 80, and Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, both from Kibbutz Nir Oz and were released from Gaza to Egypt on Monday night.\\n\\nThe militant organisation said that they had decided to release the two elderly women for \"humanitarian\" and health reasons. \"We decided to release them for compelling humanitarian and health reasons,\" the media reported quoted Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida as saying.\\n\\nHamas apparently received nothing in exchange for the release of the two hostages, who were freed days after an American woman and her teenage daughter.

       " {'articleBody': 'The appalling nature of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israeli civilians, killing more than 1,400, abducting at least 200, and firing rockets indiscriminately into civilian neighborhoods, has understandably prompted an Israeli military response.\\n\\nIt has also prompted passionate discussions on campus. I urge Princeton students attempting to make sense of the conflict to look at the unfolding situation through the lens of international humanitarian law (IHL). That law, which makes it a war crime for Hamas to target civilians, also restricts how Israel wages war. Those limits apply regardless of the justice of Israel’s decision to take military action. They are unconditional requirements, not contingent on the behavior of the other side. The most serious violations are subject to prosecution by the International Criminal Court, whose involvement is urgently needed.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe Israeli military and its supporters like to say that, unlike Hamas, Israel does not deliberately target civilians. But IHL requires far more — a series of steps designed to spare civilians as much as possible from the hazards of war. Israel’s compliance with these broader requirements has been spotty.\\n\\nIHL was codified in the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their additional protocols of 1977. The key provisions are also part of customary international law. They apply to all warring parties, whether governmental or not. Although these requirements consume hundreds of pages, their essence is straightforward. In addition to prohibiting deliberate attacks on civilians, IHL requires attacking forces not to fire indiscriminately into civilian areas even if legitimate military targets can be found there. The Israeli military’s flattening of certain Gaza neighborhoods appears to violate this rule.\\n\\nIHL also requires warring parties to refrain from attacking even a legitimate military target if the anticipated civilian harm will be disproportionate — a rule that the Israeli military’s destruction of large apartment buildings, rendering hundreds of families homeless, seems to violate. In the past, the Israeli military has cited a Hamas presence in these large complexes to justify the destruction, but it is hard to see how the military advantage justifies the enormous civilian cost. The point seems to be the destruction.\\n\\nIn addition, warring parties are required to allow humanitarian aid to civilians in need. But immediately after Oct. 7, the Israeli government blocked all food, water, medicine, fuel, and electricity to the 2.2 million people of Gaza — an act of prohibited collective punishment. By Oct. 21, a trickle of food, water, and medicine was being allowed in, but nowhere near the 100 trucks per day that the United Nations says is required. Nor had the Israeli military allowed in the fuel needed to run desalination plants and the generators that hospitals require to treat the many civilians injured by Israeli bombing.\\n\\nFinally, IHL requires warring parties to give effective advance warning of an attack if possible to enable civilians to flee. But Israel’s evacuation order for the 1.1 million civilians of northern Gaza made a mockery of the humane purpose of this requirement, because the Israeli military continued to bomb southern Gaza as well as the route to get there, and Israel’s siege left southern Gaza with no resources to receive this huge influx of people.\\n\\nThe Israeli military is also threatening that civilians who do not flee northern Gaza “may be identified as a partner in a terrorist organization.” That is what Israel did in southern Lebanon in 2006 against Hezbollah before attacking and killing civilians who remained. But there are many reasons that civilians do not flee — poverty, disability, fear, or simply a reluctance to leave their homes. None of that turns them into a legitimate military target.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe Israeli military and its backers like to cite Hamas’s use of civilians as human shields to justify the large civilian toll in Gaza, but that is an inadequate defense. IHL does prohibit using the presence of civilians to deter an attack, and it requires warring parties to take all feasible precautions to spare civilians. But even when Hamas violates these provisions, the duty remains on the attacker — Israel — to refrain from firing if the rules against indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks are violated.\\n\\nThese are not pie-in-the-sky rules concocted by human rights groups or pacifists. They were written by the world’s leading militaries, including the United States. These are not nice rules to follow until the going gets tough — they are designed for a nation’s most trying circumstances, when its troops are at war and its citizens are being killed.\\n\\nThey reflect an evolution from the “total war” approach to armed conflict in which an opponent’s civilian population was viewed as fair game. That, for example, is how Russian President Vladimir Putin has fought wars in Chechnya, Syria, and Ukraine, but few embrace that approach.\\n\\nThese rules also have a pragmatic dimension — targeting an opponent’s military is the best way to deploy scarce military resources. In addition, in the case of Gaza, it is the best way for the Israeli military to avoid inflaming the civilian population, leaving it determined to replicate Hamas even if the current leadership is killed or captured.\\n\\nGet the best of ‘the Prince’ delivered straight to your inbox. Subscribe now »\\n\\nHamas has no record of prosecuting its war criminals, and Israel has a poor record, but the International Criminal Court (ICC) provides a new option. Israel has never joined the ICC, but since 2021, the ICC has had an open investigation of the ”Situation in the State of Palestine,” meaning any war crime committed in the occupied territory or by a national of that territory. Palestine was able to join the court because in 2012, the U.N. General Assembly accepted it as a non-member observer state.\\n\\nThat a state can subject its own nationals to ICC jurisdiction is uncontroversial. Yet for years, the U.S. government opposed the ICC’s ability to prosecute crimes on the territory of an ICC member state if the alleged perpetrator’s government had not joined the court. That was the basis for President Donald Trump’s outrageous imposition of sanctions on former ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda for opening investigations in Afghanistan (which might have implicated U.S. torturers there) and Palestine (which could ensnare Israeli officials). But the Biden administration lifted those sanctions and has now even abandoned that objection by applauding the ICC’s charges against Putin for alleged war crimes in Ukraine. Ukraine has conferred jurisdiction, but Russia has not joined the court.\\n\\nEven so, the current ICC chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, undoubtedly wary of Washington’s reaction, has been slow walking the Palestine investigation since he took office in June 2021. That ongoing impunity can only encourage more war crimes. I hope the surge of war crimes by both sides in Gaza will light a fire under the ICC prosecutor’s office to promptly investigate and file charges for war crimes.\\n\\nThere may be no situation anywhere that elicits more discord and debate on the Princeton campus than the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Finding a political solution has proven extraordinarily difficult. But we should all be able to agree on the importance of both sides respecting IHL. That will reduce the civilian toll and enhance the prospect of someday finding a solution.\\n\\nKenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

What are the arrangements and preparations inside the Gaza Strip to deliver the lifesaving supplies?\\n\\nJeremy Hopkins: I want to first recognize that we have a very dedicated team of UNICEF State of Palestine staff in Gaza who have been working day and night under terrible, terrible conditions to deliver assistance. So, assistance has been ongoing since the beginning and, of course, prior to this particular terrible, terrible round of conflict. I know that our colleagues in Gaza have been repositioning the health centres with pre-positioned medical supplies, keeping some of the water systems running. I know we are down to five per cent of the normal capacity, but there are some water systems running. The only desalination plant that is still going is done so with UNICEF’s support. So, our colleagues – and I want to pay tribute to them – are doing a fantastic job in Gaza.\\n\\nWhat we know about the evolving needs is there are one million people displaced. We know that at least 300,000 children are displaced. That means they have no home right now or they are not at home, and that means that the humanitarian needs are extremely urgent. For example, according to international standards, each person should have 15 litres of water to live in health and dignity - that's drinking and washing and cooking and everything else. Right now, it's down to a little less than three litres of water per person in Gaza. We have these kind of needs and we know how to respond. We simply need the corridor to be opened so that we can respond.\\n\\nSoundcloud\\n\\nUN News: You said that what entered today is 'just a drop in the ocean'. Do you know exactly how long the supplies that arrived into Gaza today can cover the needs of people there?\\n\\nJeremy Hopkins: What went in today cannot cover the needs at all. It's a very tiny, tiny proportion of what is needed. We need to have instead of 20 trucks a day at least 100, 200 trucks going in per day - that of course depends on what is on the trucks, but approximately speaking - with food, water, medicine and fuel. That is a necessary condition for us to be able to respond to the humanitarian lifesaving requirements and needs right now.\\n\\nUN News: Since there is no ceasefire right now, what are the challenges to delivering and moving supplies across Gaza?\\n\\nJeremy Hopkins: It is going to be challenging. We need to deliver, and we have a humanitarian imperative which is driving us. At the same time, we do call for a cessation of hostilities immediately. Of course, that is the only way that we can actually deliver safely. But at the same time, we also call on the parties to the conflict to avoid any targeting of health and education facilities, which allows us to deliver the aid safely to the health facilities and everywhere that they are needed. And we also remind the parties that health staff need to be protected in order to carry out their mandate.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'The pro-terrorist, “pro-Palestinian” student mobs on college campuses are going to turn violent sooner rather than later as long as spineless university administrators continue to coddle their antisemitic students.\\n\\nThe most jarring and ominous example of this comes from the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. There, an antisemitic “pro-Palestine” (read: pro-terrorism) rally identified several Jewish students studying in the school library. Those pro-terrorism protesters then entered the library and began “barricading all exits.” The Jewish students were reportedly locked in a room by security for their own protection (which the university denies), and they had to be sneaked out through tunnels.\\n\\nWHY TRUMP\\'S FULTON COUNTY CO-DEFENDANTS KEEP TAKING PLEA AGREEMENTS\\n\\nThat is not all that is galling about this situation. University staff encouraged this protest, which, again, is a pro-terrorism celebration of Hamas’s slaughter of 1,400 Jewish civilians. Police were called but did nothing, and there is no indication that anyone has been arrested. Worst of all, the university couldn’t even bring itself to recognize the gravity of the situation, instead dismissing it by claiming that “the Library was closed for approximately 20 minutes while student protesters moved through our building. Some students who were previously in the library remained during this time. All students have now dispersed.\"\\n\\n2. Faculty members CANCELLED CLASS for the walk out, ENCOURAGED students to participate and even offered EXTRA CREDIT to do so. — Councilwoman Inna Vernikov (@InnaVernikov) October 26, 2023\\n\\n5. The NYPD did not show up right away, and when they did show up, they never entered the building, at least to the students\\' knowledge. NYPD told the students later on that @cooperunion DID NOT ALLOW THE NYPD @NYPDnews onto school grounds. (Cooper is a private institution) — Councilwoman Inna Vernikov (@InnaVernikov) October 26, 2023\\n\\nThis is going to get worse, and it is going to get worse because the leadership of most universities is as spineless as Cooper Union. Just look at George Washington University, which couldn’t even condemn the unsanctioned projection of “glory to our martyrs” and “free Palestine from the river to the sea” on the wall of the university library. These pro-massacre antisemitic student mobs are going to grow more emboldened. How long is it before one of these “demonstrations” turns violent?\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\\n\\nThe president of Cooper Union, Laura Sparks, should be forced out or resign. Every member of that student mob should be expelled at the very least. And yes, any students celebrating the slaughter of Jews at the hands of antisemitic terrorists at these university protests who are here on visas should have their visas revoked. We are at the point now that Jews have to be smuggled out of buildings for their own protection and are being told by the New York City Police Department to avoid certain areas where pro-terrorist protests are taking place.\\n\\n“Jews should definitely avoid the area”\\n\\n\\n\\n- NYPD 2023 pic.twitter.com/ePvJLCJpvC — Mendy Pellin (@MendyTV) October 26, 2023\\n\\nThis is unacceptable, and the cleanup starts on college campuses. These mobs of pro-terrorist antisemites should be discouraged by university staff, expelled when circumstances call for it (as is the case at Cooper Union), and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law whenever they commit a crime while, again, marching in favor of the slaughter of Jews. Any university administrator who drags their feet on this should be unemployed immediately because their nonchalance will only lead these mobs to escalate into something much worse.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'ARGUABLY NO COUNTRY BENEFITED more from the American invasion of Iraq than the Islamic Republic of Iran. In a war that lasted over a decade, Washington spent over $2 trillion of its own funds to eliminate one of Iran’s most powerful regional adversaries. In the process, the invasion facilitated the rise of Iraq’s militant Shia movement, which today forms the core of the Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). Although it is technically an auxiliary branch of the Iraqi security forces, the PMF regularly looks to Tehran for guidance.\\n\\nThe PMF belongs to what Iranian leaders refer to as the ‘Axis of Resistance’ (mehvar–e moqâvemat in Farsi), a term that denotes the extraordinary expansion of Iran’s influence in the Middle East and Central Asia in recent years. In addition to the PMF in Iraq, the Axis of Resistance incorporates an international coalition of dozens of armed groups, militant factions, Shia tribes, and political parties. They range from the Houthis in Yemen and the Hezbollah in Lebanon, to entire branches of the Syrian Armed Forces, and even Shia militias in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, and Bahrain. The coalition also includes a complex mosaic of armed Palestinian groups, such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad and —increasingly after 2018— Hamas.\\n\\nThese actors are certainly disparate, and often contrast with each other. For instance, relations between Hamas and the Syrians have been strained for years. All of them, however, are united in their common anti-Western stance and contempt for pro-Western states in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and Israel. Moreover, their ties under the Axis of Resistance umbrella remain informal and relatively loose. However, they all receive support —including funding and training— from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), a branch of the Iranian Armed Forces that protects and promotes the ideological inheritance of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\\n\\nSince 2011, the IRGC has viewed the Axis of Resistance as a vital element of its asymmetric military strategy. Its purpose is to help Iran successfully confront its much stronger adversaries, two of which —the United States and Israel— are nuclear-armed. That is precisely why Tehran has invested nothing short of a fortune to transform Hezbollah into what experts describe as “a force multiplier” that can give Israel a run for its money. In 2014, Tehran launched a similar effort in the Gaza Strip, initially with Palestinian Islamic Jihad —a group that, very much like Hamas, emerged out of the Egyptian Islamic Brotherhood in the 1980s.\\n\\nThe financial arrangement between Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Iran alarmed Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2008. Over time, however, Hamas too began to flirt with Iran’s Axis of Resistance, enticed by the lucrative funding and training opportunities offered by Tehran. By 2020, Hamas was actively engaging with the IRGC under the Axis of Resistance umbrella. To a significant extent, the operational sophistication of the October 7 attack on Israel, which was jointly led by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, provided clear evidence of Iran’s patronage of these two militant groups. Because of Iran, the Palestinian armed factions in Gaza are today better-armed and better-trained than at any time in the past. They will likely demonstrate that in the coming days or weeks, as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) begin their ground offensive on Gaza.\\n\\nThe big question, however, is how the other components of the Axis of Resistance will respond to the impending IDF attack. Experts are quick to point out that neither Iran nor Hezbollah are particularly excited at the prospect of joining a bloody and likely protracted war with Israel. The crumbling Lebanese state and the deeply divided Iranian society seem incapable of withstanding —let alone surviving— a major war. However, it seems unlikely that Hamas and its Gaza Strip allies would have launched such a devastating terrorist attack on Israel, with predictable far-reaching consequences for the entire Middle East, without prior coordination with the IRGC —and, by association, leading elements of the Axis of Resistance. In other words, Iran was aware of the Hamas attack and almost certainly promised Hamas that it would not face the ensuing IDF onslaught alone.\\n\\nAs the IDF is preparing to enter Gaza, Hamas leaders are acutely aware that their only hope to successfully beat back the impending Israeli onslaught is the emergence of a second front in the war, along the Israeli-Lebanese border. Only Hezbollah can make that happen, with Iran’s implicit approval. The United States was quick to send two aircraft carriers to the Mediterranean, effectively signaling to Hezbollah that it will not hesitate to enter the conflict should the Lebanese militant group open up a northern front in the war. US President Joe Biden’s unprecedented wartime trip to Israel was a clear attempt to send a similar message to Tehran.\\n\\nWill these messages suffice to convince the Iranians to keep their distance from the war, and thus throw Hamas under the proverbial bus? Perhaps. However, abandoning Hamas to its fate would create divisions in the Axis of Resistance, which Tehran has been meticulously curating for over a decade. Iranian leaders cannot afford to lose command of the Axis of Resistance, which they view as a crucial weapon in their confrontation with the United States and its allies. As one commentator noted recently, “the war in Gaza represents the first significant test event of the cooperation between the elements of the Axis of Resistance” under the leadership of the IRGC.\\n\\nMost observers agree that, at present, there is no evidence that Iran intends to broaden the conflict —which is likely bad news for Hamas. However, wars are by nature unpredictable, and Tehran has already started issuing dire-sounding threats, saying that it will “not remain a spectator” if the IDF enters Gaza. Should Iran’s threats materialize, it is unlikely that Russia and China will remain on the sidelines. The specter of a broader regional conflict lurks ominously in the background.\\n\\n► Author: Joseph Fitsanakis | Date: 23 October 2023 | Permalink',\n",

Let the enemies of freedom around the world hear us loud and clear: The people’s house is back in business,” Johnson said.\\n\\nHowever, his main challenge at hand would be to avoid a government shutdown by passing the spending bill and approving the USD100 billion request by President Joe Biden to fund the war in Israel and Ukraine.\\n\\nJohnson, whose candidature was supported by former president Donald Trump, said that he would propose a short-term measure to fund the government through January 15 or April 15.\\n\\n“So, at this time yesterday, nobody was thinking of Mike and then we put out the word and now he’s speaker of the House, so I wanted to thank all of the supporters that I have and I want to thank all of the supporters Mike has, and again he will be a great speaker,” Trump said after the election of the new speaker.\\n\\nIn his speech, Johnson indicated that he is getting down to business immediately. “The American people’s business is too urgent at this moment,” he said.\\n\\n“We’re in the majority right now. We’ve gone through a little bit of suffering. We’ve gone through a little bit of character building. And, you know what it’s produced? More strength, more perseverance, and a lot of hope. And that’s what we are about to deliver to the American people,” Johnson said, adding that he would have an aggressive schedule in the days and weeks ahead. US President Joe Biden said he is looking forward to working with the Speaker Johnson.\\n\\nAccording to the White House, this afternoon, Biden called Johnson to congratulate him on his election, and expressed that he looks forward to working together to find common ground on behalf of the American people “While House Republicans spent the last 22 days determining who would lead their conference, I have worked on those pressing issues, proposing a historic supplemental funding package that advances our bipartisan national security interests in Israel and Ukraine, secures our border, and invests in the American people. These priorities have been endorsed by leaders in both parties,” Biden said in a statement.\\n\\n“We need to move swiftly to address our national security needs and to avoid a shutdown in 22 days. Even though we have real disagreements about important issues, there should be mutual effort to find common ground wherever we can,” he said.

And we're calling on the international community to send help with medical equipment and supplies and medicine, so we support the field hospital to be able to handle the amount of the wounded. But if it continues down this path, with the closure of borders in this way, then it will be a very difficult situation.\\n\\nMARTIN: As we've reported, Israel has tightened its blockade on Gaza, preventing water, food and fuel from entering the region.

My grandparents, never being allowed to return.\\n\\n“My family witnessed 75 years of violence against Palestinian people-most notably, brutal settler invasions which led to the destruction of entire communities, murder in cold blood, and the forcible removal of families from their homes.

The pain of that is unimaginable.”\\n\\nBella placed the responsibility for the ongoing crisis on governments rather than the religious beliefs of the people.“We must all stand together in defending humanity and compassion – and demanding that our leaders do the same. All religions are peaceful – it is governments that are corrupt, and intertwining the two makes for the greatest sin of all. We are one, and God has created all equal.

Even so, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres may have crossed a line in recalling the genesis of the coordinated terror attack on multiple places that Hamas carried out with an unparalleled show of barbarity.\\n\\nOf course, there is a history to it, as much as there will be to any militant movement. And yet there can be no justification whatsoever for acts of terror, even if the epic suffering of today is a result of historical occupation of places the Palestinians lived in. The way the UN secretary general said it about Palestine, it did sound as if he was justifying Hamas’ barbarous acts.\\n\\nThe UN Secretary-General did condemn the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that has brought the region to its current state teetering on the brink of a wider conflict, with Israel facing the prospect of a two-front war as Hezbollah’s commando force in southern Lebanon is straining at the leash while the leadership in Beirut advises restraint. But in doing so while castigating the other side for inflicting a collective punishment on the Palestinians, he has proved to be less diplomatic and far too political while calling for a humanitarian ceasefire.\\n\\nNothing takes place in a vacuum, not even a UN meeting or the right to veto that renders it powerless to exert any of its collective decisions. With the Security Council hamstrung, the UN General Assembly’s nonbinding decisions can do little when man takes on man and transforms into an animal-like avatar bent upon death and destruction.\\n\\nThe UN is not going to help end this war. Even the US, while calling for restraint as a trickle of hostages are being released by Hamas terrorists, has said that Israel will decide for itself when to go ahead with the ground offensive to get at the Hamas leadership. Will reason return in time is the only question that needs to be answered now but UN politics will not be aiding it.\",\n",

Founded in 1964, it initially sought to keep the borders of Palestine intact. But later it changed its stance during Oslo Accords in 1993 and agreed to accept Arab state within Palestinian territories. Despite its renouncement of violence, it allegedly participated in second Intifada. Since 2018, it has stopped all forms of economic and security cooperation with Israel.\\n\\nHamas: The full name of the organisation is H.arakah al-Muqāwamah al-Islāmiyyah meaning Islamic Resistance Movement. Shortly after the first Intifada, Palestinian activist Ahmed Yassin formed Hamas. Against their secular counterpart Fatahs, Hamas gained popularity rejecting the Oslo Accords during late 1990s. In 2006, they won the Palestinian legislative election and took control of Gaza Strip. Though a few times Hamas came on the discussion table tending to accept the 1967 borders as a solution, their continuous engagement in suicide bombing and offensives against civilians brought on them the tag of terrorists.\\n\\nSabbath: In Judaism, every Saturday is considered to be the day of ‘Sabbath’ (Shabbat/Shabbos), a day for religious observance. Tragically, several attacks and hate crimes against the Jewish people in the past have taken place on the day of Sabbath. In 2002, 12 Israeli Jews were ambushed and killed by Palestinian resistance militants following Friday Prayers in the West Bank city of Hebron, becoming a flash point between Jew and Arab conflict.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIntifada: Intifada or Intifadah in Arabic means resistance. The first Intifada or organised uprising of Palestinians against Israeli occupation dates back to December 1987. While this uprising went on for six years ending in 1993 Oslo Accords, the second Intifada gathered strength in the 2000s.\\n\\nZionism: Zionism is the Jewish nationalism movement that had the singular goal of the creation (or re-establishment) of the Jewish national state in Palestine which Zionists consider to be the ancient homeland of Jews. The movement was established as a political organisation in 1897 under Theodor Herzl, and was later led by Chaim Weizmann. While Israel was formed in 1948, essentially ending the mandate of the Zionist movement, Zionist organisations in many countries continued to raise financial support for Israel and to encourage Jews to immigrate there.\\n\\nAl Aqsa: Located in the Old City of Jerusalem in Israel, the Al-Aqs.ā Mosque has been at the centre of the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict for decades. Muslims believe that the Prophet Mohammad was miraculously transported to this mosque from Mecca. But the Jews believe it to be the site of the mythic Temple Of Jerusalem. As of now, sections of the mosque plaza are open to Jewish worshippers. Since the Six Day War of 1967, Israel has occupied East Jerusalem and the Old City but the mosque remains under the custodianship of the Islamic Waqf board maintained by Jordan’s Hashemite dynasty. But Palestinian Muslims often claim to face harassment and restrictions in accessing the mosque.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nKibbutz: Kibbutz in Hebrew means ‘gathering’ or ‘clustering’. It is known as an intimate society that voluntarily resides together to build up a cohesive lifestyle. The society engages in different forms of productions ranging from farm goods to high-tech industrial products. Taking its ideological cue both from socialism and Zionism, the first Kibbutz was founded in 1910 and gradually it started participating in state formation. According to the available data, in 2010, there were around 270 Kibbutz in Israel with a population of 1.26 lakh.\\n\\nFatah: The full name of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement or Fatah is H.arakat al-tahrīr al-watanī al-Filastīnī. Founded in 1959 as a political movement and in 1965 as a political party, Fatah has been the largest faction of the PLO, the multi-party confederation. Fatah’s foundational leader Yaseer Arafat has been one of the major faces of Palestinian resistance for years until his death in 2004. In 2006, Fatahs lost their political clout and majority in Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) to Hamas.\\n\\n—Compiled by Abhik Bhattacharya and Rakhi Bose',\n",

The UAE rejected the resolution, while Brazil and Mozambique abstained.\\n\\nThe Russian draft resolution, which was also put to a vote, called for an \"immediate humanitarian ceasefire\" and unequivocally condemns the attacks of Oct. 7 and the \"indiscriminate attacks\" on civilians and civilian targets in Gaza.\\n\\nIn that vote, four countries voted in favor – Russia, China, the UAE, and Gabon. The United States and the UK voted against it, and nine countries abstained.\\n\\nThe resolution wasn\\'t adopted because it failed to get the minimum nine \"yes\" votes.\\n\\nThe failure of the two resolutions followed the council\\'s rejections last week of a Russian resolution that didn\\'t mention Hamas and also failed to get nine \"yes\" votes and a widely supported Brazilian resolution vetoed by the US that would have condemned the Hamas attacks and all violence against civilians and called for \"humanitarian pauses.\"\\n\\nRussia\\'s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia justified the veto by saying that the US draft resolution could be interpreted as the Security Council\\'s support for Israel\\'s plans to start a ground operation in Gaza.\\n\\nNebenzia warned that Israel\\'s prospective forceful operation in Gaza carried out in the current manner and with gross violations of human laws and massive loss of civilian life, risks provoking a larger conflict that could encompass the entire region and even go beyond its borders.\\n\\nWhereas the Chinese delegate Zhang Jun said the US draft resolution was \"out of balance\" and \"deeply divisive\" on the urgent issue of ending the fighting.\\n\\nHe called it \"evasive on the most urgent issue of ending the fighting,\" saying it does not reflect the world\\'s strongest calls for a ceasefire or an end to the fighting and does not help resolve the issue.\\n\\n\"At this moment, ceasefire is not just a diplomatic term. It means the life and death of many civilians.\"\\n\\nAfter the double veto, the US ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the 15-member council that Washington was deeply disappointed that Russia and China vetoed this resolution.\\n\\n\"Though today\\'s vote was a setback, we must not be deterred.\"\\n\\nAlso, US representative Robert Wood said that the \"bad faith resolution\" put forward by Russia lacked consensus and failed to reflect realities on the ground.\\n\\n\"It was regrettable that Moscow chose to further divide the Council rather than address the needs of Israel and Palestine,\" he added.\\n\\nBritish delegate Barbara Woodward said the US draft would have had a tangible impact on the ground by calling for humanitarian pauses and the hostages\\' release.\\n\\nShe added that the British delegation voted against Russia\\'s text as it failed to recognize Israel\\'s right to self-defense.\\n\\nThe deep divisions in the Security Council caused frustration among several diplomats.\\n\\nA diplomat said France tried vainly to persuade Russia and the US to withdraw their texts before referring them to a vote.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the UAE Ambassador, Lana Nusseibeh, said the UN and humanitarian organizations have made clear that what is essential is a humanitarian ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and sustained humanitarian access to Gaza.\\n\\nNusseibeh said there were \"dozens of statements imploring this council to assign the same value to Palestinian life as it does to Israeli life,\" adding: \"We cannot allow any equivocation on this point.\"\\n\\nIn response, Israel\\'s UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan thanked the US and other nations that supported its resolution for condemning \"savage genocidal terrorists while standing up for the values of freedom and security.\"\\n\\nHe denounced those who voted against the resolution, saying they showed the world the Security Council is incapable of condemning \"terrorists and cannot confirm the right to self-defense of the victim of these heinous crimes.\"\\n\\nAfter the failure of the US and Russian drafts, Malta\\'s UN Ambassador Vanessa Frazier, speaking on behalf of the ten elected council members serving two-year terms, announced they would be working on a new proposal in the coming days.\\n\\n\"As elected members of this council, we also represent the rest of the international community, and we have a duty and an obligation to act,\" Frazier told the council. \"There is no time to waste.\"',\n",

The laws of armed conflict apply to all parties involved in a war, regardless of whether states claim they are defending themselves.\\n\\nWhat laws govern the conflict?\\n\\nThe 1949 Geneva Conventions, which have been adopted by all UN member nations, established internationally recognised guidelines for armed combat. These guidelines are further strengthened by decisions made by international war crimes tribunals.\\n\\nThe \"Law of Armed Conflict\" or \"International Humanitarian Law\" is the collective term for a set of treaties that regulate how citizens, soldiers, and POWs are treated. It covers both organised armed groups, such as Hamas and government forces.\\n\\nWhat acts could violate war crimes law?\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch, based in New York, listed the intentional destruction of civilians, the indiscriminate firing of rockets, the kidnapping of civilians by Palestinian armed organisations, and the Israeli counterattacks in Gaza that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians as potential war crimes.\\n\\nThe Geneva Conventions expressly forbid the abduction of hostages, murder, and torture. Israel\\'s response may also be the focus of a war crimes investigation.\\n\\nFollowing the attack by Hamas, Israel besieged Gaza, a city of 2.3 million people, and began the most massive bombing campaign in the 75-year history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, demolishing entire neighbourhoods.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed alarm about \"clear violations of international humanitarian law\" in Gaza and begged for the protection of people.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat do the Geneva Conventions say?\\n\\nProtecting civilians during armed conflict and reducing suffering during hostilities is the main objective of the Geneva Conventions and, by extension, international humanitarian law.\\n\\nMembers of state armed forces, volunteer and military forces, and non-state armed groups are all considered combatants under the laws pertaining to armed conflict.\\n\\nIf a siege is deemed to be disproportionate or targets people instead of being a legal way to weaken Hamas\\'s military capabilities, it may be classified as a war crime.\\n\\nUnder the laws of armed conflict, it is legally unlawful to target civilians or civilian objects directly. Nonetheless, there are situations in which ordinarily innocuous objects can turn into acceptable targets for the military.\\n\\nEven in that case, strikes against military targets must be proportionate—that is, they cannot cause an undue number of civilian casualties or damage to civilian property.\\n\\nThe concept of proportionality does not include comparing the number of civilian casualties on opposing sides; rather, it implies that the number of civilian deaths should be commensurate with the actual and tangible military advantage that is anticipated from that particular strike.\\n\\nWhich institutions can try alleged war crimes?\\n\\nLocal courts, in this case, those in Israel and the Palestinian territories, will hear cases pertaining to alleged war crimes first.\\n\\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague is the only international court authorised to file charges if suspects are not prosecuted domestically.\\n\\nThe Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court, grants it the legal power to look into claims of crimes committed by citizens of its member states or on their territory when local authorities are \"unwilling or unable\" to do so.\\n\\nWhat is the role of the ICC?\\n\\nThe permanent war crimes tribunal for the world, the International Criminal Court (ICC), was established in the Hague in 2002. It has jurisdiction over crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide committed by citizens of its 123 member nations or in those states.\\n\\nMany of the world\\'s superpowers, such as Egypt, China, Russia, India, and the United States, are not members. While Israel does not openly interact with the International Criminal Court (ICC) and rejects its authority, the ICC accepts Palestine as a member state.\\n\\nICC prosecutors are currently looking into 17 cases, spanning from Sudan and Myanmar to Ukraine and Afghanistan, despite having small personnel and funding.\\n\\nSince 2021, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has been looking into claims of war crimes and crimes against humanity that may have been perpetrated in the occupied Palestinian territories.\\n\\nIt hasn\\'t released any warrants for arrest.',\n",

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also expressed confidence in a major victory.\\n\\nEvacuation in Northern Israel\\n\\nThe Defense Ministry and the Israel Defense Forces announced the evacuation of residents from the northern city of Kiryat Shmona to state-subsidized guest houses due to repeated rocket and missile attacks by the Hezbollah terror group and other Palestinian factions.\\n\\nHumanitarian Crisis\\n\\nThe situation in Gaza remains critical, with Israel blocking essential supplies of water, electricity, food, and fuel. With the Egypt-Gaza border crossing in Rafah still closed, the already dire conditions at Gaza’s second-largest hospital deteriorated further, warned Dr. Mohammed Qandeel of Nasser Hospital in the southern town of Khan Younis. Power has been cut in most departments to save it for intensive care and other vital functions, and staff members were using mobile phones for light.\\n\\nThe Gaza Health Ministry has pleaded with gas stations to give whatever fuel they had left to hospitals. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees has given some of its last remaining fuel supplies to hospitals, spokesperson Juliette Touma said. More than 200 trucks and some 3,000 tons of aid are still positioned at or near Rafah, according to Khalid Zayed. the head of the Red Crescent for North Sinai.\\n\\nThe conflict has resulted in significant casualties on both sides, with over 3,700 people killed in Gaza and more than 1,400 people killed in Israel. Over 1 million Palestinians, approximately half of Gaza\\'s population, have fled their homes since the conflict began, seeking refuge in UN-run schools-turned-shelters or with relatives.',\n",

About 1,400 Israelis were killed in a surprise attack by Hamas on Oct. 7, while Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes have since left 5,500 dead in Gaza, according unverified data from the Gaza Ministry of Health, an agency of the Hamas-controlled government.\\n\\nAt the rally and teach-in on Sproul Plaza, the protesters demanded that UC Berkeley divest from arms manufacturers that create weapons used by Israel and make a public statement supporting Palestine.\\n\\n“We denounce the one-sided and dehumanizing narratives parroted by politicians, corporations and institutions, including UC Berkeley and especially Berkeley Law School, regarding the genocide of the people of Gaza,” Abo Emad, a UC Berkeley student, said at the rally.\\n\\nSince Hamas seized power in 2007, Israel has blockaded the Gaza Strip, home to more than 2 million Palestinians, controlling trade and restricting residents’ movement in and out of Gaza.\\n\\nStudent organizers led the crowd in chants decrying Israeli brutality and backing Palestine’s right to what students described as justified resistance while a handful of young people waved the Israeli flag nearby. “Israel, Israel, you can’t hide.

On the day of the attack by Hamas, Bears for Palestine, a pro-Palestinian campus group, released a statement offering its “unwavering support of the resistance in Gaza,” describing it as the product of decades of violence by Israel.\\n\\nA statement signed by at least 250 UC Berkeley faculty condemned the portrayal by some on campus of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks as a freedom fight to be celebrated. “This is repugnant and indefensible,” the statement said.\\n\\n“[I]t was shocking to realize that literally while Hamas terrorists were going house-to-house seeking to murder as many Jews as they could, some pro-Palestinian organizations on our own campus were gathering petition signatures for statements that celebrated these Hamas terrorists as freedom fighters and rejected any critiques of their actions,” the statement said.\\n\\nDisturbed by what he saw as a broader attitude against Jews on campus, UC Berkeley Law professor Steven Davidoff Solomon urged law firms not to hire students who sided with anti-Zionist student groups in an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nBerkeley Hillel organized their own teach-in today, “exploring Jewish sources for peace, justice and truth,” according to a statement posted on Instagram.\\n\\nFrom the sideline near the stage, a small group of Jewish and pro-Israel UC Berkeley students silently attended the rally. “We wanted to give them respect to protest, too.

       " {'articleBody': \"Biden makes deal on aid delivery to Gaza\\n\\nIn his visit to Israel, President Biden made a deal on limited humanitarian aid delivery to Gaza. Twelve days ago, Hamas killed 1,400 people in Israel. More than 3,400 people have been killed in Gaza.\\n\\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\\n\\nAnd I'm Ari Shapiro in Tel Aviv, Israel, where President Biden took center stage today on a hastily arranged trip here to Tel Aviv. It's the 12th day since the Hamas attack that killed 1,400 people in Israel. Rockets continue to fly from Gaza toward Israel, and intense Israeli bombardment has killed more than 3,400 people in the Gaza Strip. NPR's Ruth Sherlock is here with me in Tel Aviv and NPR's Jackie Northam is in Jerusalem. Good to have you both here.\\n\\nRUTH SHERLOCK, BYLINE: Thanks so much, Ari.\\n\\nJACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Thanks, Ari.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: Jackie, let's start with you. This is a fraught trip by Biden as the entire region tensely watches and Israel prepares for a possible ground invasion of Gaza. What did Biden say today?\\n\\nNORTHAM: You know, Ari, Biden's visit was really meant to send a message that the U.S. continues to fully support Israel. And, you know, the visit comes at a time when emotions are still raw here in Israel after the multipronged attack by Hamas militants on October 7. And, you know, in a speech after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden compared it to the 9/11 attacks in the U.S. He said he understood the shock and the all-consuming rage that Israelis must feel and how they want justice. Here he is.\\n\\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\\n\\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: But I caution this - while you feel that rage, don't be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.\\n\\nNORTHAM: And, Ari, of course, after 9/11, the U.S. invaded Iraq, and now Israel is preparing for a possible invasion of the Gaza Strip. You know, also, Biden reminded Israelis that the vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas and that the militant group does not represent the Palestinian people.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: Did Biden have anything to offer Palestinians?\\n\\nNORTHAM: He announced $100 million in aid to help civilians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, but that probably won't do much right away given the situation, the deteriorating situation in Gaza. He also said he secured a commitment from Israel to allow humanitarian aid deliveries from Egypt into Gaza as soon as possible, you know, food, water, medicine. Israel has up until now not allowed aid in, fearing that Hamas militants could smuggle weapons into Gaza on the aid convoys. But Biden warned that if Hamas diverts or steals the assistance, the aid stops. But, you know, to be honest, these shipments could be held up by Egypt or Israel anyway.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: All right. Well, Ruth, Biden's trip, as you know, was disrupted by events here. After days of Israeli bombings in Gaza, there was an explosion at a hospital where people had sought shelter. Hundreds were killed. We still don't know the exact number. And there are different claims about what happened. So are the facts any clearer today? What can you tell us?\\n\\nSHERLOCK: Well, Ari, what we are seeing is, you know, terrible footage of people wounded, being rushed away, including children just covered in blood, crying. And like you say, the Baptist al-Ahli Hospital, it was being used by families as a place to shelter. They had fled the bombardment in other areas thinking that this place was safe. I reached Dr. Fadel Naim. He's the head of the orthopedic unit there, and he was in the operating theater when the explosion happened. He ran outside and found people wounded and dying.\\n\\nFADEL NAIM: Some of them died in our hands...\\n\\nSHERLOCK: So he's saying, you know, some of them died in our hands, others had huge injuries like limbs amputated. They were bleeding out, and we were trying to do everything we could to stop that. He said he used his own - you know, doctors used their clothes to try to stem the bleeding. Now, both Israel and Palestinian leaders have tried to trade blame over who is responsible.\\n\\nIsrael says this was the result of a failed rocket launched by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the militant group. And it's put out some video footage and other material it says is evidence. And now President Biden says data provided by the Pentagon backs Israel's claims. But I should be really clear here, you know, NPR cannot independently verify any of this. And it's still early days to know what really happened.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: But even beyond the hospital, there is so much desperation and pain in Gaza. What is life like for people living there right now?\\n\\nSHERLOCK: I mean, Ari, resources are running out, medicine is running out, fuel is running out. And I spoke with Aed Yaghi. He's a doctor in Gaza. And he told me even drinking water is becoming scarce.\\n\\nAED YAGHI: The people, they are seeking hours to find water, any water. There is no water, no electricity. The food is short, there's shortage of food in the markets.\\n\\nSHERLOCK: Like Jackie said, you know, there have been lines of aid trucks waiting at the Egyptian border to go into Gaza. But Israel, which controls Gaza's borders, has been blocking that aid from coming in. Today, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's office said that they will allow in some aid to go through Egypt to southern Gaza. But the Israeli Defense Ministry told NPR it doesn't appear that that will include fuel, which is essential for supporting water desalination plants and hospitals.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: Jackie, looking a little more broadly - even as Biden spoke, there were protests going on in other countries. How widespread were those?\\n\\nNORTHAM: They're gaining strength, you know? There were - the anti-Israeli street protests really erupted immediately after the explosion at the Gaza hospital, so we're seeing, you know, places like Egypt, Bahrain and Lebanon. Even the State Department ordered the voluntary departure of family members from Lebanon. You know, the concern, Ari, is that all this could intensify if Israel does launch a ground war, ground invasion, as it has indicated. It could all just sort of spiral out of control, and that's the real fear.\\n\\nSHAPIRO: That is NPR's Jackie Northam in Jerusalem and Ruth Sherlock here in Tel Aviv. Thank you both for your reporting.\\n\\nSHERLOCK: Thank you so much.\\n\\nNORTHAM: Thanks, Ari.\\n\\nCopyright © 2023 NPR. All rights reserved.

Austin III.\\n\\n\"Today, US military forces conducted self-defense strikes on two facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and affiliated groups. These precision self-defense strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against USpersonnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on October 17. As a result of these attacks, one US citizen contractor died from a cardiac incident while sheltering in place; 21 U.S. personnel suffered from minor injuries, but all have since returned to duty,\" Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said.\\n\\nThe US strikes reflect the Biden administration\\'s determination to maintain a delicate balance. The US wants to hit Iranian-backed groups suspected of targeting the US as strongly as possible to deter future aggression, possibly fueled by Israel\\'s war against Hamas, while also working to avoid inflaming the region and provoking a wider conflict.\\n\\nUS F-16 fighter jets targets Iran-backed sites in Syria\\n\\nAccording to a senior US military official, the precision strikes were carried out near Boukamal by two F-16 fighter jets, and they struck weapons and ammunition storage areas that were connected to the IRGC. The official said there had been Iranian-aligned militia and IRGC personnel on the base and no civilians, but the U.S. does not have any information yet on casualties or an assessment of damage. The official would not say how many munitions were launched by the F-16s.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nA senior defense official said the sites were chosen because the IRGC stores the types of munitions there that were used in the strikes against US bases and troops. The two officials briefed reporters after the strikes on condition of anonymity to provide details on the mission that had not yet been made public.\\n\\nAccording to the Pentagon, there have now been at least 19 attacks on U.S. bases and personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17, including three new ones Thursday. Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said 21 U.S. personnel were injured in two of those assaults that used drones to target al-Asad Airbase in Iraq and al-Tanf Garrison in Syria.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWith inputs from AP\\n\\nALSO READ | Former Chinese Premier Li Keqiang dies at 68 after suffering heart attack\\n\\nLatest World News',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Gaza-based Qassam Brigades has been waging an armed resistance against Israeli occupation since its founding in 1992.\\n\\nHamas has been in the spotlight since October 7, when its military wing, the Qassam Brigades, launched an attack on Israeli territory, killing about 1,400 people and taking more than 200 people captives.\\n\\nIsrael has pledged to finish all wings of the Palestinian resistance group, which has been governing the Gaza Strip since 2007, in the wake of the attack. It has killed more than 6,500 Palestinians in indiscriminate bombings that the United Nations chief said were “clear violations of international humanitarian laws“.\\n\\nIsrael has launched six major assaults on Gaza since its troops withdrew from there in 2005. In 2012, it killed Ahmad Jabari, the chief of the Qassam Brigades, in air raids.\\n\\nHere’s what to know about the origins and evolution of the Brigades:\\n\\nWhat is Hamas and when was it founded?\\n\\nHamas was founded by Sheikh Ahmed Yasin and his aide Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi as an offshoot of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood in 1987. The association lasted until 2017 when Hamas indicated ending its ties with the Muslim Brotherhood.\\n\\nHamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya (Islamic Resistance Movement) – means zeal.\\n\\nIt emerged during the first Intifada against Israeli occupation during which thousands of Palestinians came out to protest peacefully against Israeli land expropriation and illegal settlements. After a harsh response to their protest, Palestinians started to use rocks, and some groups resorted to small arms.\\n\\nHamas favoured armed resistance to liberate Palestine and opposed the 1993 Oslo Accords, saying Israel used the deal to expand illegal settlements on territories occupied in 1967.\\n\\nIn 2006, the group decided to participate in elections in Gaza. It won, but the transfer of power was not peaceful, as Fatah – the party that dominates the Palestinian Authority (PA) – tried to oust them from the Gaza Strip.\\n\\nIsrael imposed a land, sea and air blockade on the enclave after Hamas took power, and it still decides what and who goes in and comes out of the Strip – making it effectively an “open-air prison”.\\n\\nIsmail Haniyeh, who had close ties with Hamas founder Yasin, leads the political wing of Hamas today.\\n\\nAccording to a survey by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in March, most Palestinians would vote for Haniyeh over current PA President Mahmoud Abbas or his Fatah party.\\n\\nHamas’s continued social welfare activities, including food distribution during Ramadan and building schools, have solidified its support.\\n\\nWhat is the Qassam Brigades?\\n\\nHamas established its military unit in 1992 to centralise and structure the military actions its fighters had been taking against Israel in the 1980s and 1990s.\\n\\nThe name is inspired by a Syrian fighter, Ezzedine al-Qassam, who struggled against British occupation after he was expelled to Palestine, according to the group’s official website.\\n\\nMohammed Deif is the military commander, assisted by his deputy, Marwan Issa.\\n\\nThe Qassam Brigades’ actions against Israel have helped Hamas gain popularity among large segments of Palestinians, according to experts.\\n\\nThe PA has become unpopular as it has failed to stop illegal settlements and continues security coordination with Israel. It became further marginalised by the rise of extreme far-right Israeli politics.\\n\\nHow strong are the Qassam Brigades?\\n\\nAccording to the CIA World Factbook, the Qassam Brigades have 20,000 to 25,000 members, although this number is disputed.\\n\\nThe Brigades have lost thousands of fighters in Israeli attacks and its resources have been depleted in Israeli air raids.\\n\\nIsrael’s 2005 withdrawal from Gaza provided Hamas with the opportunity to rebuild its military wing. Financial support, allegedly from Iran, is said to have enabled the armed group to develop sophisticated military capabilities. Hamas sees its arsenal as a crucial deterrent.\\n\\nWhat is the Qassam Brigades’s military activities?\\n\\nThe Brigades are said to acquire their weapons through smuggling, allegedly getting some military support from Iran, and making some weapons locally, according to the CIA Factbook. Al Jazeera, however, could not independently verify the claims.\\n\\nThey tend to rely on rocket attacks and have added drones to their arsenal recently.\\n\\nAccording to a 2021 report by the US Department of State, the Qassam and other Palestinian armed groups launched more than 4,400 rockets in confrontations with Israel in 2021. In 11 days of fighting, at least 260 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes while Israeli fatalities stood at 13.\\n\\nReports say the Qassam has expertise in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and rocket launchers, antitank missiles and mortars, but they rely a great deal on strategy and stealth, with an extensive tunnel infrastructure that enables them to move around undetected.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy did Hamas attack on October 7?\\n\\nHamas said its attack was in response to Israeli violations of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and rising settler violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.\\n\\nIt also said that it had managed to take enough captives to bargain for the release of Palestinian prisoners languishing in Israeli jails, and some analysts have said the acceleration of Arab-Israeli normalisation may have been another factor.\\n\\n“This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on Earth,” said Deif, the Qassam Brigades military commander. He openly called on supporters and Muslim nations to join the armed struggle.\\n\\nWhat are Gaza’s other armed resistance groups?\\n\\nOther armed groups in Gaza have indicated that they are joining the current resistance against Israeli forces.\\n\\nChief among them are the Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s Saraya al-Quds Brigades. Formed in 1992, al-Quds has claimed responsibility for at least 23 rocket attacks, according to data gathered by the Critical Threats Project.\\n\\nThe Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine also has an active military presence in Gaza through the Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades and has been joining calls for armed resistance through official Telegram messages.',\n",

Mirdamadi reiterated that Iran\\'s involvement in the war is not likely to end well for Tehran.\\n\\nWhile criticizing the government for its over-reliance on Russia instead of seeking to lift US sanctions and engage in negotiations to revive the JCPOA nuclear deal with world powers, Mirdamadi was the first influential reformist to announce a critical stance regarding the Gaza war.\\n\\nSpeaking about the development with Iran International television on Wednesday, commentator Mohammad Rahbar said that in Mirdamadi\\'s statement, the \"government\" is in fact an alias to refer to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.\\n\\nIncidentally, the interview was published,and the press review was aired on the same day that Khamenei once again praised the militant group Hamas for its terror attack on Israel and said that Palestinians will ultimately win the war.\\n\\nMirdamadi also argued that as the war in Gaza continues, any development other than elimination of Hamas will be tantamount to a defeat for Israel. Agreeing with the essence of what the regime says about Hamas having inflicted a heavy blow on October 7, he portrayed Israel as significantly weakened.\\n\\nHe said that unlike the first days of the war, the world\\'s public opinion and media have now turned in favor of the Palestinians and Israel has been the loser and if the current trend continues it is going to be the final loser of the war.\\n\\nMirdamadi reiterated, \"While Israel has repeatedly declared that its final objective is the total elimination of Hamas, any result other than that will be a defeat for Israel.\" He added: \"If Israel is not the winner of the war, one of the consequences of this for Israel will be the decline of its status.\"\\n\\nIn the unlikely event that Israel defeats Hamas, he argued, Israel’s enemies in the region will be weakened. “In this case, Israel will go the extra mile eliminating Hamas and Palestinians and will begin to eliminate other regional forces such as the Lebanese Hezbollah,\" Mirdamadi said, adding that \"However, doing so will spread the war and will entangle the region in a continuous conflict.\"\\n\\nMirdamadi, one of the most influential reformist figures after former President Mohammad Khatami, who was once the leader of Iran\\'s most powerful reformist party Mosharekat [Particiation], made sure to say in the interview that Khamenei also believes not to directly get involved in the Iarael Hamas war.\\n\\nHe said Khamenei is aware of the dangers of getting involved in a direct confrontation [with Israel and the United States] and advised other Iranian politicians to avoid any statement that might heighten the risk for Iran\\'s intervention in the war. However, he pointed out that some Iranian officials took inappropriate positions contrary to what Khamenei thinks.\\n\\nHe insisted that so far, Israel has been humiliated and no matter what the end result of the war might be, the idea of establishing an independent Palestinian state will be strongly supported once the conflict ends. Mirdamadi opined that Western countries will inevitably support the idea of an independent Palestinian state in order to prevent further crises.\\n\\nIranian commentator Morteza Kazemian told Iran International news on Wednesday that Khamenei\\'s new position on the war in Gaza is likely to have been inspired by his isolation and by part of UN Chief Antonio Guterres and the United Arab Emirates\\' UN envoy\\'s speech at the UN in which they criticized Western governments for their one-sided support of Israel, although he also continued his usual bragging against Europe, the United States and Israel. Kazemian also accused Khamenei of having no concern about the lives of children and other civilians in Gaza.',\n",

Ghazi Hamad is a former newspaper editor and politician, heading top roles in Hamas for 25 years. In 1999, Hamad was jailed by the Palestinian Authority for writing critically about its prison system. His experiences later saw him become a top spokesperson for the Hamas government, a platform from which he once said: 'Israel should be wiped from the face of the Earth. It is an animal state that recognizes no human worth. It is a cancer that should be eradicated.' Hamad has previously expressed support for a Palestinian state under its pre-1967 borders.

       " {'articleBody': 'The bombing of Gaza is now in its third week. Israel continues to kill and wound several thousand innocent civilians and destroy infrastructure, including mosques, hospitals, residential buildings, schools, UN premises, refugee camps, and any asset that it suspects of harbouring armed groups. Simultaneously, Gaza has been deprived of energy, food, water, and healthcare, for which it depended on Israel. Israel has also mobilised its armed forces, including land, maritime, and air power, which are poised to invade Gaza. It has called for the evacuation of the northern part of Gaza.\\n\\nHamas, the initial instigator in this round of conflict, has ravaged Israel by killing, wounding, taking hostages, and destroying property. Its methods involved breaching the border fence and launching attacks, primarily against civilians and some military targets, often accompanied by rocket fire aimed at cities and towns, including capital Tel Aviv. In response, Israel hit back primarily with air power, triggering a major humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\\n\\nInformation has the power to create, shift, or sustain already held beliefs. Beliefs, in turn, influence and determine individual and collective behaviours and are often shaped by the narratives at play. In the ongoing Hamas-Israel war, the battle of narratives could play a crucial role in determining the course of events, including the cessation or continuation of hostilities.\\n\\nAlso read: How Gaza hospital blast united Arab world against Israel amid Tel Aviv’s attempts to normalise ties\\n\\nInformation warfare is on\\n\\nThe tragic events in the Gaza-Israel conflict are being beamed on the internet for the rest of the world. The power of images is understandably influencing beliefs, shaping narratives and driving global responses from governments and the public. These narratives are layered upon the backdrop of ongoing geopolitical turbulence, which is, essentially, a power struggle between the US and China that seeks to reshape the existing world order dominated by US-led Western powers. Not surprisingly, the United Nations remains a bystander in efforts to end the violence in the Israel-Gaza war.\\n\\nThere are now two major global hotspots—Ukraine in Eastern Europe and Israel-Palestine in the Middle East. The Gaza-Israel War is deeply rooted in history and carries within it the powerful force of religion, which has forever unleashed the beast in humankind. The spike in global support for the Palestinian cause, especially in the Arab world, is fanned by religious ties rooted in Islam. The ghosts of narratives regarding Islam’s historical confrontations with Christianity and Judaism in the Middle East have inevitably been galvanised.\\n\\nThe recent bombing of the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza city is emblematic of the ongoing battle of narratives being waged to portray the other as responsible for the loss of hundreds of innocent lives, that too of the injured and refugees fleeing from the scourge of war. It does not matter what the truth is, whether Israel’s version is supported by the US and its allies or the Hamas group was responsible. What matters to the popular imagination is the intrinsically crystallised political, ideological, and cultural disposition that colour their perceptive lenses. For those of the Islamic faith, the Hamas version reinforces their existing beliefs about Israel’s beastliness. For Israel, the US and its partners, it is a Hamas conspiracy driven by the manipulation of social media to garner sympathy and support.\\n\\nThe surge in demonstrations, protests, and violence in the West Bank, several Arab countries, and other parts of the world against Israel reflects the truism that, in the battle of narratives, Hamas has succeeded in distancing the Arab world from Israel and rekindling support for the Palestinian cause, which had been forsaken by their Islamic brethren in the Arab world in recent years. The separate peace-making efforts of the US and China to reconcile Saudi Arabia-Israel and Iran-Saudi Arabia have suffered a major blow. This does not bode well for global stability, even as the war continues to spread and escalate.\\n\\nGeographically, Israel’s border with Lebanon has seen cross border skirmishes, with reports of Iranian backed Hezbollah seeking to open another front against Israel. Israel has struck international airports in Syrian cities of Damascus and Aleppo, ostensibly to prevent Iran from supplying personnel, arms, and ammunition to Lebanon and Syria. Reports indicate that Iran-backed militias have deployed to southern Lebanon and southwestern Syria. Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has warned of a multi-front war against Israel, and Iranian-backed militias may take preemptive actions. However, Iran continues to signal its unwillingness to enter into a direct war with Israel.\\n\\nThe US has deployed two aircraft carrier groups in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Israel to deter Iran. The Pentagon spokesperson has acknowledged a spate of drone attacks on American bases in Iraq and Syria and stated that an American destroyer in the Red Sea intercepted cruise missiles and drones launched by Iran-supported Houthis in Yemen against Israel.\\n\\nAlso read: ‘Palestine issue will become excuse to ask Muslims to leave India’ — Jamiat chief at pro-Palestine meet\\n\\nChallenges for India\\n\\nUS President Joe Biden’s recent visit to Israel signified support for the country but he also cautioned Israel not to repeat the mistakes committed by America after 9/11 when it allowed anger and a desire for revenge to dictate its actions. Yet, Israel continues to wreak havoc in Gaza, which can only result in strengthening the cycle of revenge apart from uniting the West Bank and Gaza. The West Bank could become a third front if Israel launches an invasion there. Given its losses in the information domain, Israel would be able to retain American support due to the US’ internal politics. But reactions of others may differ and may not favour Israel. The question is: what should be India’s reaction?\\n\\nInitially, India’s stance appeared skewed in favour of Israel when Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on 10 October following a telephone conversation with his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu: “Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel. Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families. We stand in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour.” This reaction pertained only to the terrorist attack on Israel. But some believed that India, under Modi, had prioritised its relationship with Israel at the expense of its traditional support for the Palestinian cause. The contents of the PM’s tweet were somewhat balanced by MEA spokesman Arindam Bagchi on 12 October in reply to a media query. He reaffirmed that India’s longstanding support for the Palestinian cause remains unchanged.\\n\\nThe larger point is that the initial impression has remained in the popular imagination, and for some, India’s initial position was anchored in the ruling BJP’s stance against Islam—a fact that has been on display on Indian social media platforms. An article in Al Jazeera reveals that after the Hamas attack on 7 October, numerous right-leaning accounts in India spread Islamophobic disinformation. The article quotes the editor of the Indian non-profit fact-checking website, AltNews: “With India now exporting its disinformation actors in the Indian mainstream media and on social media in support of Israel, hopefully the world will now realise how the Indian right-wing has made India the disinformation capital of the world.” These developments must be viewed as part of the information warfare playing out, which fuels communal divisions in India’s domestic politics.\\n\\nThe Israel-Hamas conflict is likely to add to the challenges India faces in navigating the turbulent geopolitical times. For starters, the proposed India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) seems dead in the surrounding waters. It is also likely that the sails of some terrorist groups adversarial to India will be boosted by the winds of geopolitical emotions generated by the Hamas-Israel war. These could find expression in Kashmir and/or in carrying out terrorist attacks on sensitive targets, especially those with religious significance.\\n\\nIndia must prepare for harder times, as the information domain gains prominence and AI-driven technology makes it nearly impossible to discern fact from fiction. Information, as the currency of power, is being wielded to exert greater control over populations in autocracies. In democracies, the enhancement in exposure and the rapid flow of information provides ample room for radicalisation, especially when issues carry religious undertones.\\n\\nIt is becoming increasingly feasible to manipulate beliefs and trick a large number of people for longer periods of time. The battle of narratives is finding a greater degree of success through disinformation, deceit, deception, and propaganda, injecting hate and hostility into an increasingly polarised world. The war clouds are darkening.\\n\\nLt Gen (Dr) Prakash Menon (retd) is Director, Strategic Studies Programme, Takshashila Institution; former military adviser, National Security Council Secretariat.

(AFP)\\n\\nMacron gave no details on how the U.S.-led coalition of dozens of countries, of which Israel is not a member, could be involved. His advisers said, however, that the coalition\\'s participation would not necessarily imply boots on the ground, but could include intelligence-sharing.\\n\\nSpeaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, Macron stressed that France and Israel shared terrorism as their \"common enemy\".\\n\\n\"France is ready for the international coalition against Daesh in which we are taking part for operations in Iraq and Syria to also fight against Hamas,\" he told reporters, referring to Islamic State.\\n\\nMacron, who warned against the risks of a regional conflict, also said the fight against Hamas \"must be without mercy but not without rules\".\\n\\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not directly comment on Macron\\'s proposal but said the fight was a battle between the \"axis of evil\" and \"the free world\".\\n\\n\"This battle is not merely our own... it\\'s everybody\\'s battle,\" he said.\\n\\nThe U.S-led coalition fighting Islamic State was formed in September 2014.\\n\\nMacron\\'s office said the idea was to draw inspiration from the coalition and that France was available to discuss with Israel and partners what could be relevant against Hamas.\\n\\n\"The international coalition against Daesh does not limit itself to operations on the ground, but is also involved in the training of Iraqi forces, the sharing of information between partners, and the fight against terrorism funding,\" it said.\\n\\nCareful to strike a balance, Macron also met with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah, where he said the Hamas attack was not only traumatic for Israel, it was a disaster for the Palestinian people.\\n\\n\"A Palestinian life is worth a French life, which is a worth an Israeli life,\" Macron said, repeating the need for a two-state solution he said was necessary so Palestinians don\\'t follow the \"mirages of the most radical terrorist groups.\"\\n\\nAbbas, who said France\\'s voice was respected in the region, called for an immediate cessation of the \"aggression\" on Gaza and for protection for Palestinians.\\n\\nHowever, some protesters took to Ramallah\\'s streets to demonstrate against Macron\\'s visit and burned pictures of him. \\'Macron, stop your support for Israel,\\' read one of the banners.\\n\\nThirty French citizens were killed by Hamas militants in their attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, in which more than 200 people were seized and 1,400 people killed.

       " {'articleBody': \"On Wednesday evening, Gaza is expected to run out of fuel. Cars and ambulances will no longer be able to reach hospitals; generators and water pumping stations will cease working; humanitarian efforts on the ground will collapse, aid workers tell TIME.\\n\\nFor the first time since Israel began launching airstrikes in Gaza, in retaliation to Hamas’ surprise attack on Oct. 7 that killed 1,400 people in Israel, 20 trucks carrying essential aid were allowed to pass through the Rafah crossing from Egypt into Gaza on Saturday. A further 34 trucks of aid have since entered Gaza and are solely being administered by the U.N., whose biggest agency on the ground is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).\\n\\nBut experts say the deliveries—first brokered by the U.S. and containing food, medicine, and other medical supplies—are a drop in the bucket of what Gazans need.\\n\\nRead More: The Gaza Healthcare System Is Reportedly on the Brink of Collapse\\n\\n“It’s a glimmer of light but it’s not enough,” Juliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, tells TIME from Amman, Jordan, where she has recently moved to from East Jerusalem. “If we don't have fuel, Gaza will collapse. The people of Gaza will collapse, and the largest humanitarian operation which is run by UNRWA will come to a halt,” Touma says. She adds that fuel is needed to keep the bakeries that are feeding people and the hospitals open, both of which are struggling.\\n\\nAt least 5,087 Palestinians have been killed since Israel began launching airstrikes in the enclave, which is one of the most densely populated places on Earth. But Gaza has long faced a humanitarian crisis; the Strip has been under a 16-year blockade before the latest escalation. As a result, 1.2 million Gazans were already relying on food assistance from UNRWA.\\n\\nAmid global calls for a ceasefire, and the fight to establish a permanent humanitarian aid corridor, here’s what to know about aid efforts into Gaza.\\n\\nRead More: As War Rages in Gaza, Violence Surges in the West Bank\\n\\nHow much aid went to Gaza before the war?\\n\\nBefore the Israel-Hamas war broke out, Gaza’s 2.2 million citizens required an average of 500 trucks of aid and fuel per day from a number of organizations. Such deliveries took place at Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing point, while the Erez crossing point was used by aid workers, a small number of Palestinians working in Israel, and Gazans with a permit to seek health services in Israel. Aid typically included food and water assistance, as well as health and education services.\\n\\n“UNICEF has been providing health material medicine and that includes, for example, the support to frontline clinics, support to rehabilitation of primary health care units. That also includes the creation of a neonatal unit in one of Gaza's Hospitals,” Jonathan Cricks, a spokesperson for UNICEF, tells TIME. He adds that the organization also supported Gazans with mental health and psychosocial needs, citing UNICEF figures that 816,000 children have needed these services since 2008.\\n\\nOne of the most vital lifelines UNICEF and other organizations provide is safe drinking water. “There is a desalination plant that was developed and when it's fully functioning it is supposed to provide potable, safe water for 250,000 people,” Cricks says. The lack of electricity and fuel has left Gazans to ration three liters (0.79 gallons) of water per day for cleaning, cooking, and drinking, well below then the international standard of 15 liters (3.3 gallons) needed in an emergency situation, according to the World Health Organization.\\n\\nCricks adds that UNICEF has water and hygiene kits waiting at the Egyptian border ready to enter when more trucks are approved.\\n\\nMeanwhile, UNRWA—which operates across Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan—also runs 700 schools across the region. “We give an education to more than half a million boys and girls,” Touma says. Some of these schools in Gaza are now acting as a refuge for people who have lost their homes during airstrikes.\\n\\nThe major organizations who administer aid and humanitarian services in Gaza are the World Health Organization, the World Food Programme, the Red Cross, the Red Crescent, and Doctors Without Borders. UNRWA remains the largest humanitarian operation on the ground.\\n\\nHow is aid administered in Gaza?\\n\\nAid previously entered the Gaza Strip via Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing point. But aid organizations have had to quickly establish new routes via Egypt’s Rafah crossing following the Israel-Hamas war. “It’s a very complex logistics operation,” Touma says. “The U.N. overall, and other humanitarian organizations, have to set up this operation almost from scratch.”\\n\\nRead More: Our Death Is Pending.’ Stories of Loss and Grief From Gaza\\n\\nWhen trucks enter Gaza, the U.N. is responsible for the distribution of supplies, Touma says. “It's a lot of physical work. It's actually quite dangerous for our own staff to do this because they're doing this sometimes late at night, sometimes during the bombardments and the airstrikes,” Touma says.\\n\\nSome 35 of UNRWA colleagues stationed in Gaza have been confirmed as killed by airstrikes.\\n\\nSo far, food, bottled water, and some medicine have been received and administered. Israel has warned that aid deliveries will once again be halted if supplies are seized by Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. But Touma says UNRWA—who has been on the ground for seven decades and built local trust—operates on a “strict scrutiny system” for aid distribution. Deliveries are monitored and audited so they reach the vulnerable, she adds.\\n\\nWhat are humanitarian organizations calling for?\\n\\nTouma warns that UNRWA has been in a “deep financial crisis” for the best part of a decade. This has left the agency with little to no reserves for an unprecedented crisis like the one unfolding now in Gaza.\\n\\nDonations from around the world are rising as the death toll in Gaza surges. But aid officials tell TIME they are only helpful if they can continuously reach those in need.\\n\\nAs such, most humanitarian groups are calling for a sustained route into Gaza to deliver vital aid. UNICEF’s resources have quickly depleted, says Cricks. “That’s why we are asking for a humanitarian corridor that is safe and sustained,” he adds.\\n\\nTouma says that there are efforts taking place “at the highest level” of the U.N. to advocate for a regular and sustained supply of aid and fuel into Gaza. “There are also efforts to reach a humanitarian ceasefire,” she says.\",\n",

There are also armored vehicles in this convoy of the Israeli army.\\n\\nDozens of tanks can be seen bombing after entering Gaza, during the night the Israeli army targeted Hamas bases, command centers, rocket launchers and destroyed them. The Israeli army attacked Gaza, damaging Hamas. But neither Hamas could stop Israel nor could Hamas sympathizers do anything.\\n\\nBy launching a ground attack in northern Gaza, Israel has sent a message to the Arab countries that its war against Hamas will not slow down. No matter how much Arab countries unite and try to save Hamas. In fact, many Arab countries consider Hamas's attacks justified and are trying to put pressure on Israel to stop this war, but Israel has vowed not to back down.\\n\\nThis is a big step of Israel towards completely eliminating Hamas, till now the US was preventing Israel from carrying out ground attacks. But Israel has made its intentions clear, that it will go to any extent to avenge the deaths of its citizens and eliminate Hamas.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Israel just showed the trailer, the real picture of the ground attack in Gaza will be revealed in a week. Because Prime Minister Netanyahu has given a clear-cut message that the Israeli army will soon take major ground action to destroy Hamas.\\n\\nThe blueprint of the ground attack has been prepared. Within a week, Israel will now take major action against Gaza, planning to gain full control of the disputed territory which has caused tensions between Israel and Palestine for five decades.\\n\\nWhile Israel and Hamas continue to be at war, the real price is being paid by the citizens of Gaza. Thousands of Gaza citizens have died due to bombings and constant attacks by Israeli military, and lakhs have been left without food and water.\",\n",

It governs more than two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, but the group is best known for its armed resistance to Israel. In October 2023, Hamas launched a massive surprise attack on southern Israel, killing hundreds of civilians and soldiers and taking dozens more as hostages. Israel has declared war on the group in response and indicated its military is planning for a long campaign to defeat it.\\n\\nDozens of countries have designated Hamas a terrorist organization, though some apply this label only to its military wing. Iran provides it with material and financial support, and Turkey reportedly harbors some of its top leaders. Its rival party, Fatah, which dominates the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and rules in the West Bank, has renounced violence. The split in Palestinian leadership and Hamas’s unwavering hostility toward Israel have diminished prospects for stability in Gaza.\\n\\nWhat are the group’s origins?\\n\\nHamas, an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya (“Islamic Resistance Movement”), was founded by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a Palestinian cleric who became an activist in local branches of the Muslim Brotherhood after dedicating his early life to Islamic scholarship in Cairo. Beginning in the late 1960s, Yassin preached and performed charitable work in the West Bank and Gaza, both of which Israel occupied following the 1967 Six-Day War.\\n\\nYassin established Hamas as the Brotherhood’s political arm in Gaza in December 1987, following the outbreak of the first intifada, a Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. At the time, Hamas’s purpose was to counter Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), another organization whose commitment to violently resisting Israel threatened to draw Palestinians’ support away from the Brotherhood. In 1988, Hamas published its charter, calling for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic society in historic Palestine. In what observers called an attempt to moderate its image, Hamas presented a new document [PDF] in 2017 that accepted an interim Palestinian state along the “Green Line” border established before the Six-Day War but that still refused to recognize Israel.\\n\\nHamas first employed suicide bombing in April 1993, five months before PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the Oslo Accords. The historic pact established limited self-government for parts of the West Bank and Gaza under a newly created entity called the Palestinian Authority (PA). Hamas condemned the accords, as well as the PLO’s and Israel’s recognition of each other, which Arafat and Rabin officially agreed to in letters sent days before Oslo.\\n\\nIn 1997, the United States designated Hamas a foreign terrorist organization. The movement went on to spearhead violent resistance during the second intifada, in the early 2000s, though PIJ and Fatah’s Tanzim militia were also responsible for violence against Israelis.\\n\\nWho are its leaders?\\n\\nHamas has a host of leadership bodies that perform various political, military, and social functions. General policy is set by an overarching consultative body, often called the politburo, which operates in exile. Local committees manage grassroots issues in Gaza and the West Bank.\\n\\nIsmail Haniyeh currently serves as political chief, having replaced longtime leader Khaled Meshaal in 2017. Haniyeh has operated from Doha, Qatar, since 2020, reportedly because Egypt restricts his movement into and out of Gaza. Hamas leaders established a presence in Qatar after falling out with their previous host, Syria, when Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War. Some senior Hamas figures reportedly operate out of the group’s offices in Turkey.\\n\\nDay-to-day affairs in Gaza are overseen by Yahya Sinwar, who previously headed Hamas’s military wing and served twenty-two years in an Israeli prison for masterminding the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers. He was among the more than one thousand Palestinian prisoners freed in 2011 in exchange for an Israeli soldier held by Hamas. As of June 2021, Gaza’s de facto prime minister is Issam al-Da’alis.\\n\\nMarwan Issa and Mohammed Deif command Hamas’s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. Israeli forces assassinated the militia’s founder, Salah Shehadeh, in a 2002 air strike. Fifteen civilians were killed in the attack, focusing Israeli and international scrutiny on such tactics. Israeli forces killed Yassin, Hamas’s founder, in 2004.\\n\\nSaleh al-Arouri reportedly heads Hamas’s Lebanon branch. He also took over the group’s West Bank leadership following internal elections that concluded in 2021, while Meshaal was chosen to lead the diaspora office and Salameh Katawi was elected to manage the affairs of imprisoned Hamas members.\\n\\nHow is Hamas funded?\\n\\nAs a designated terrorist entity, Hamas is cut off from official assistance that the United States and European Union (EU) provide to the PLO in the West Bank. Historically, Palestinian expatriates and private donors in the Persian Gulf provided much of the movement’s funding. In addition, some Islamic charities in the West have channeled money to Hamas-backed social service groups, prompting asset freezes by the U.S. Treasury.\\n\\nGaza’s economic situation was already dire before Hamas’s 2023 assault on Israel, and the ensuing war is almost certain to exacerbate the extreme poverty of its residents. Egypt and Israel largely closed their borders with it in 2006–07, restricting the movement of goods and people into and out of the territory. The two countries maintain a blockade today, cutting off the territory from most of the world and forcing more than one million Gazan Palestinians to rely on international aid. Israel has allowed Qatar to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance through Hamas. Other foreign aid generally reaches Gaza via the PA and UN agencies.\\n\\nDaily News Brief A summary of global news developments with CFR analysis delivered to your inbox each morning. Most weekdays.

After Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi took power in 2013, Cairo became hostile toward Hamas, which it saw as an extension of its chief domestic rival, the Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian army shut down most of the tunnels breaching its territory while it waged a counterterrorism campaign against a branch of the self-proclaimed Islamic State on its side of the border, on the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt began to allow some commercial goods to enter Gaza through its Salah al-Din border crossing in 2018. As of 2021, Hamas reportedly collected upward of $12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported into Gaza.\\n\\nToday, Iran is one of Hamas’s biggest benefactors, contributing funds, weapons, and training. Though Iran and Hamas briefly fell out after backing opposing sides in Syria’s civil war, Iran currently provides some $100 million annually [PDF] to Hamas, PIJ, and other Palestinian groups designated as terrorist organizations by the United States. Iran was quick to praise Hamas’s assault on Israel in late 2023 and pledge its continuing support for the Palestinian group.\\n\\nTurkey has been another stalwart backer of Hamas—and a critic of Israel—following President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s rise to power in 2002. Though Ankara insists it only supports Hamas politically, it has been accused of funding Hamas’s terrorism, including through aid diverted from the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency.\\n\\nHow does it govern Gaza?\\n\\nHamas has been the de facto authority in Gaza since shortly after Israel withdrew from the territory in 2005. The following year, Hamas won a majority of seats in the PA’s legislature and formed a government. It earned votes for the social services it provided and as a rejection of the incumbent Fatah, which many voters perceived as having grown corrupt at the helm of the PLO and delivering little to Palestinians through its negotiations with Israel. The outcome was unacceptable to Fatah and its Western backers, and the party ousted Hamas from power in the West Bank. In Gaza, Hamas routed Fatah’s militias in a week of fighting, resulting in a political schism between the two Palestinian territories. Palestinians have not voted for a legislature since 2006, nor a president since 2008.\\n\\n“The Hamas-controlled government has no effective or independent mechanisms for ensuring transparency in its funding, procurements, or operations.” Freedom House\\n\\nAs Hamas took over the remnants of PA institutions in the strip, it established a judiciary and put in place authoritarian institutions. In theory, Hamas governs in accordance with the sharia-based Palestinian Basic Law, as does the PA; but it has generally been more restrictive than the law requires, including by controlling how women dress and enforcing gender segregation in public during the early years of its rule. The watchdog group Freedom House found in 2020 that the “Hamas-controlled government has no effective or independent mechanisms for ensuring transparency in its funding, procurements, or operations.” Hamas also represses the Gazan media, civilian activism on social media, the political opposition, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), leaving it without mechanisms for accountability.\\n\\nHow do Palestinians view Hamas?\\n\\nThe political bifurcation of the West Bank and Gaza is widely unpopular: a June 2023 poll [PDF] by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) showed that one-third of Palestinians consider it the most damaging development for their people since the state of Israel’s 1948 creation. The same poll found that more than half of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank would vote for Hamas’s Haniyeh over PA President Mahmoud Abbas in a presidential election, while just one-third of Palestinians would choose Abbas. Additionally, Abbas has indefinitely postponed national elections scheduled for 2021, citing Israel’s alleged refusal to let Palestinians in East Jerusalem vote, though observers suspect that Abbas aims to prevent a likely Hamas victory.\\n\\nHow has Hamas challenged Israel?\\n\\nHamas has fired rockets and mortars into Israel since the group took over the Gaza Strip in the mid 2000s. Iranian security officials have said that Tehran provided some of these weapons, but that Hamas gained the ability to build its own missiles after training with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and proxies. In recent years, Israel estimated that Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in Gaza had about thirty thousand rockets and mortars in their arsenal. Hamas militants have flown balloons carrying incendiary devices toward Israel, which have sometimes caused fires. The group has also carried out incursions into Israeli territory, killing and kidnapping soldiers and civilians.\\n\\nPrior to the 2023 conflict, Hamas and Israel had their deadliest fighting in years in 2021, when Hamas fired rockets into Israel following weeks of tensions between Palestinians and Israelis in Jerusalem. Some analysts say that Hamas wanted to bolster its reputation as the defender of the Palestinian cause after the PA postponed the 2021 elections. During the eleven-day conflict, Hamas and PIJ fired more than four thousand rockets from Gaza, killing ten Israeli civilians and injuring more than three hundred others. Hamas reportedly coordinated with the IRGC and Lebanon’s Hezbollah during the fighting, and used so-called suicide drones along with its usual arsenal of less precise missiles. The United States and Egypt brokered a cease-fire to the conflict.\\n\\nHow is Hamas’s attack on Israel in 2023 different?\\n\\nHamas’s assault on southern Israel this year, which the group’s leaders have called “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm,” was extraordinary in its strategy, scale, and secrecy, analysts say. It began early in the morning on October 7, the Jewish Sabbath and an important Jewish holiday, with Hamas launching several thousand rockets into southern and central Israel, hitting cities as far north as Tel Aviv. Hamas militants also breached the heavily fortified Gaza border and infiltrated many southern Israeli towns and villages, killing hundreds of Israeli troops and civilians, and wounding and kidnapping scores more.\\n\\nHamas’s military leader, Mohammed Deif, said the group undertook its assault because of Israel’s long-running blockade of Gaza, its occupation of Palestinian lands, and its alleged crimes against Muslims, including the desecration of Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\\n\\nIt is the deadliest attack on Israeli soil in decades and has inflicted a deep psychological trauma on the Israeli people, with some analysts drawing comparisons to the surprise Pearl Harbor and September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Israeli and U.S. intelligence agencies reportedly had no indications that Hamas was planning an assault of this nature. “It is completely unprecedented that a terrorist organization would have the capacity or the wherewithal to mount coordinated, simultaneous assaults from the air, sea, and land,” writes CFR Senior Fellow Bruce Hoffman.\\n\\nIsrael has declared war on Hamas and countered with intensifying air strikes on targets in Gaza and ground operations to push the group’s militants out of the country. The government has ordered the evacuation of all civilians from Israeli communities bordering Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned of a “long and difficult war” against Hamas, and Israel’s military response is expected to be extraordinary, if not unprecedented.\\n\\nSome observers are questioning if Israel will attempt a full-scale invasion and reoccupation of the Palestinian territory, a campaign that could incur heavy casualties on both sides. “Israel had mounted numerous military operations against Hamas since its takeover in 2007, two years after Israel pulled out of Gaza. But these were mostly from the air. And even when Israeli troops were deployed, they never stayed for long,” writes CFR Senior Fellow Max Boot for the Washington Post.\\n\\nAn Israeli invasion of Gaza could also provoke a significant attack against Israel by Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon, risking a wider conflagration in the region, analysts say. “Iran is, of course, a patron of Hezbollah [as well as Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups] and there is an ever-present danger of a two-front conflict, which would devastate parts of Israel and much of Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based. There is a risk of escalation,” says CFR Senior Fellow Steven A. Cook.\",\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Advertisement\\n\\nIn the wake of the Israel conflict, Aditya Raj Kaul, an Indian journalist known for his pro-BJP views, posted on X (formerly Twitter) about the atrocities committed by Hamas, alleging that a pregnant woman was dissected by Hamas, killing the unborn child. As of writing, the post has been viewed 10.2 million times with more than 21,000 retweets, including one from Ben Shapiro, who disseminated it to his large following.\\n\\nHowever, this story remains unverified.\\n\\nThe Israel-Palestine conflict was a hotbed for conspiracies and false information even before the current flashpoint. While researchers so far have found minimal evidence of disinformation of foreign origin, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip has nonetheless observed a surge in misinformation. This reveals the significance and salience of the digital battlefield in modern day warfare and combat, engaging the participation of citizens beyond the Middle East in a battle of discourse and ideology.\\n\\nAmid this fragmented information sphere, the manufacture of and engagement with pro-Israel content among Indian nationals, more significantly among right-wing Hindu nationalists, have not escaped popular attention.\\n\\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\\n\\nBOOM, a reputable Indian fact-checking service, found several verified Indian X users at the front and center of a “disinformation campaign” that targets Palestine with negative news while supporting Israel. In one instance, a video purporting to show young girls taken by a Palestinian fighter as sex slaves was circulated on X. This video had no context and was likely from a school trip to Jerusalem, but this was shared widely by Indian accounts.\\n\\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access.\\n\\nFact-checker Pratik Sinha has referred to India as the “disinformation capital of the world” due to the rise of right-wing nationalism in the country. There have been attempts to attribute the spread of false information in India on the Israel-Gaza conflict to the BJP’s IT Cell, a department within the ruling party that handles its social media accounts and campaigns. However, beyond the element of state-sponsorship in the spread of mis- and disinformation, this episode reveals wider trends surrounding fake news and grassroots engagement in the production, dissemination, and export of misinformation in India.\\n\\nThe Politics of India-Israel\\n\\nThe links drawn between India and Israel are not new. Ideological resonance has been observed for a long time between the two countries, and this has grown in recent years with the rise of a more muscular Hindu nationalism in India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nScholars have identified the solidarity and affinity among Hindu nationals in India for the Israeli cause, pointing to heavy ideological resonance between Hindutva and Zionism. Madhav Golwalkar, former head of the BJP’s ideological wing, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), articulated a vision of the Hindu nation emphasizing the racialized notion of a state, drawing parallels with Zionism.\\n\\nThis understanding of the Hindu nation has continued to influence the current BJP government under Modi, manifesting in policies like the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which has been compared to Israel’s discriminatory Law of Return. Both measures grant citizenship rights to ethnic majority individuals beyond the state while denying Muslims within the state citizenship rights. For Hindu nationalists, the religious significance of Israel’s sovereignty serves as an aspirational model.\\n\\nMore recently, Modi departed from India’s usual neutrality in conflicts, which was maintained in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, by issuing a strong statement of support for Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in response to Hamas’ attacks. This move reflects the close diplomatic ties established between Modi and Netanyahu since 2014, with Modi being the first Indian prime minister to visit Israel and Netanyahu calling him a “kindred spirit.” This camaraderie has set the tone for India-Israel relations, and India’s economic and strategic ties with Israel are increasingly apparent.\\n\\nWhile India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) asserts that India recognizes and supports the Palestinian cause and advocates for the “resumption of direct negotiations towards establishing a sovereign, independent, and viable State of Palestine living within secure and recognised borders, side by ide at peace with Israel,” Modi’s leanings toward Israel reflects what has been called his “biggest ideological departure from Congress on Middle East policy.”\\n\\nThe Right-Wing Digital Network\\n\\nThe transnational nature of right-wing ethnonationalist affinities presents the possibility to observe and study right-wing nationalism as a network. This virtual ecosystem has become the fertile ground for normalization and dissemination of hate, fueling calls for violence within these networks.\\n\\nWithin Israel, there is an observed normalization of right-wing extremist views within Netanyahu’s new coalition, which features the inclusion of the far-right in the government. This right-wing allyship can also be seen in Israel’s embrace of far-right movements across Europe – and in the strengthening ties between India and Israel.\\n\\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access.\\n\\nIn reflection of this solidarity, Israeli Ambassador to India Naor Gilon congratulated India on its Cricket World Cup win over Pakistan, announcing on X that he is glad that Pakistan would now be unable to achieve a victory that it would have attributed to Hamas. Gilon also added an emotional note, thanking “Indian friends” for “showing their solidarity with Israel by displaying posters during the match.”\\n\\nWorryingly, this camaraderie has trickled down to the populace. Beyond the political sphere, the right-wing nationalist network serves as a social phenomenon and a mobilizing force in society. The internet as a global civic space has facilitated the flourishing of digital populism, marked by the use of the internet for participation and mobilization, and the creation of an environment conducive for the circulation of nativist and xenophobic narratives.\\n\\nAt the grassroots level, the pervasive impact of the rise of Hindutva can be seen in the prevalence of pro-Israel sentiments among supporters of the Hindu right. These ideological affinities between Hindu nationalists and Israel manifested online long before the ongoing conflict. Since Modi assumed office in 2014, it has become common to see tweets from Hindu nationalists expressing unwavering support for Israel and Netanyahu. This sentiment is often referred to as the “India-Israel brotherhood,” and these expressions of support often go hand-in-hand with condemnations of Palestine, Pakistan, and even Muslims in general, further underscoring the shared ideological alignment between these two groups.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGrassroots Disinformation and the Right-Wing Digital Network\\n\\nWhile this exploitation of international events to fuel domestic events is not new, what can be observed is the emergence of a voluntary and decentralized disinformation campaign by Hindu nationalists in support of Israel. Calling themselves “digital champions” of Israel, individual accounts with large followings push unverified one-sided news against Hamas, which have gained substantial momentum online. This phenomenon has not escaped the attention of global netizens, and it has triggered an onslaught of memes and satirical content aimed at the Hindu nationalists’ vocal support for Israel.\\n\\nThe fervor of Indian netizens for Israel was evident even before the recent escalation of violence. The recognition of said support has since been put on the record, with the official account of Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ thanking India after “India is with Israel” trended on Twitter.\\n\\nDisinformation and the right-wing network are mutually reinforcing. First, disinformation utilizes narratives derived from this right-wing network, with the success of the campaign riding on the highly emotive nature of right-wing beliefs. As the current conflict unfolds, Israel’s intense retaliation toward Hamas and the deadly strikes against Gaza are being co-opted by Hindu nationalists to advance their anti-Muslim agenda. The intertwining of domestic politics with larger global issues has given fresh voice to the stoking of anti-Muslim hate as narratives borrowed from a foreign conflict are used to justify the persecution of Muslims in India.\\n\\nSecond, the spread of disinformation containing right-wing narratives serves to circulate, perpetuate, and therefore reinforce “rhetoric and motifs” common and central to a variety of right-wing and far-right discourses.\\n\\nBut the right-wing network does not bear sole responsibility for the fragmented information landscape. The larger Israel-Palestine conflict remains a highly affective one; people of different cultures and creeds find themselves and their own experiences in one facet of the conflict or another. Individuals consume and thus perpetuate misleading information that bolsters their worldview, contributing to the onslaught of misinformation.\\n\\nThe Ever-Evolving Landscape of the Conflict Information Sphere\\n\\nAmid conflicting, partisan information, netizens, experts, and traditional media continue to debate who perpetrated the devastating bombing of the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza. However, as of now, this remains undetermined.\\n\\nIn a post on X, a user that claiming affiliation with Al Jazeera alleged that she witnessed a misfired Hamas rocket hitting the hospital. Al Jazeera later released a statement to clarify that said user has no ties to the network. Multiple X users have pointed out the user had previously only posted on Indian politics and cricket, only recently turning her attention to Gaza, insinuating her origin.\\n\\nAs the violence in Gaza becomes increasingly egregious, Modi has conveyed his condolences at the loss of lives at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza, pledging that India will continue to send humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people. Indian netizens are divided on Modi’s stance, however, amid the ideological alignment and friendship with Netanyahu’s Israel. The dynamism of the unfolding events may thus see the pluralization of narratives and grassroots disinformation attempts targeted at both sides of conflict. But one thing is for certain: In the case of Indian social media, digital boots are continually deployed on the information battlefield.',\n",

He said the effort wasn’t aimed against “people who believe in the Islamic faith” but simply was about opposing terrorism. “All of us here are opposed to terrorism,” he said, according to the Associated Press at the time. “That’s all this is about.”\\n\\n26.\\n\\nIn 2016, he won his seat in the northwest corner of the state by more than 30 points against a pro-life, pro-gun Democrat.\\n\\n27.\\n\\n“As a matter of practicality and constitutional principle, the federal government should only be involved in disaster recovery when the scope of a disaster is so catastrophic that it overwhelms the capabilities of state and local governments,” Johnson said in 2016 when the Shreveport Times asked the candidates in that year’s campaign whether they would support lobbying the federal government for aid for disaster relief in the wake of recent flooding in the area. “Allowing a lower standard for federal funding is simply unsustainable, because it creates an incentive for state governments to seek aid for even small, routine events.”\\n\\n28.\\n\\n“In terms of financial assistance from the federal government, there’s no doubt that that will be necessary,” he said the following summer as Hurricane Harvey headed toward Louisiana.\\n\\n29.\\n\\nA climate-science skeptic, he’s raked in more campaign cash in his congressional career from the oil and gas industry than any other industry, and he’s repeatedly downplayed climate change, according to E&E.\\n\\n30.\\n\\nHe considers himself a Constitutional “textualist” and treats his town halls in his district, he has said, partially as “Civics 101, Poli-Sci 101, Philosophy 101.”\\n\\n31.\\n\\nHe was a new guy on the Hill and the opposite of a Trump favorite after he voted against Trump’s first attempt to overturn Obamacare in 2017. “I thought that might be the end of my career,” Johnson told the Shreveport Times. “The conversation was pretty intense.”\\n\\n32.\\n\\nIn 2017, Johnson supported Trump’s “Muslim Ban” executive order, which restricted travel to the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim countries. “This is not an effort to ban any religion, but rather an effort to adequately protect our homeland. We live in a dangerous world, and this important measure will help us balance freedom and security,” Johnson said of the order.\\n\\n33.\\n\\nIn 2018, Johnson was one of a group of Republicans arguing for student-led prayer and religious expression in public schools under the First Amendment.\\n\\n34.\\n\\nAfter he was reelected in 2018, House Republicans elected him chair of the Republican Study Committee, a perch that made for a launching pad for the likes of Mike Pence and fellow Louisianan Steve Scalise.\\n\\n35.\\n\\nHe is currently serving his second term as vice chair of the House Republican Conference, and serves on the House Judiciary Committee.\\n\\n36.\\n\\nJohnson, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, supports ending American military aid to Ukraine during its war with Russia.\\n\\n37.\\n\\nHe is rated as the 27th most effective Republican member of Congress by the Center for Effective Lawmaking at Vanderbilt.\\n\\n38.\\n\\nJohnson was part of Trump’s inner circle and traveled regularly with him on Air Force One while he was president. “It’s surreal,” he once told a Shreveport reporter. “When I call him, he calls back within a couple of hours.”\\n\\n39.\\n\\nHe was an eager backer of the nomination to the Supreme Court of Amy Coney Barrett, a friend since 1988.\\n\\n40.\\n\\n“I have just called President Trump to say this: ‘stay strong and keep fighting, sir! The nation is depending upon your resolve. We must exhaust every available legal remedy to restore Americans’ trust in the fairness of our election system,’” he posted on social media four days after Election Day in 2020.\\n\\n41.\\n\\nHe was a lead organizer of the December 2020 amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, the Supreme Court lawsuit contesting the election results.\\n\\n42.\\n\\n“I don’t see a grand conspiracy,” he said in the middle of that month. “What I see is a lot of chaos and confusion across the land, and the result is that this election will have this giant question mark hanging over it. I saw a new poll: a huge amount of the country doubts the election and thinks it was stolen from Donald Trump. Thirty-six percent of registered voters in America believe the election was stolen. That is a problem. Whether it was stolen or not, the fact that such a huge swath of the country believes that it was is something that should keep all of us up at night.”\\n\\n43.\\n\\n“And I am a lawyer. I don’t engage in conspiracy theory. I want to deal in fact and truth,” he added.\\n\\n44.\\n\\nTrump, he believes, is an institutionalist. “He doesn’t articulate it in the same way that some old constitutional-law nerds would,” he said, “but that’s what he is.”\\n\\n45.\\n\\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Johnson voted against certifying the 2020 election.\\n\\n46.\\n\\nAs a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Johnson was one of Trump’s fiercest defenders in his impeachment hearings, leading Trump to include him in his defense team for the Senate impeachment trial, in which he was acquitted. About this, Johnson said, “His ultimate gesture of trust was asking me to serve on the impeachment defense team. It was an extraordinary experience.”\\n\\n47.\\n\\nJohnson, along with all other House Republican leaders in 2021, voted against establishing a national commission to investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection.\\n\\n48.\\n\\nJohnson had been floated as speaker before. In 2022, Rep. Andy Biggs proposed Johnson as speaker over Kevin McCarthy. After the House voted to remove McCarthy as speaker earlier this month, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz showed his support for Johnson as a candidate.\\n\\n49.\\n\\nRunning for Congress in 2016, he signed the congressional term limits pledge of the organization called U.S. Term Limits: “I pledge that as a member of Congress I will cosponsor and vote for the U.S. Term Limits amendment of three (3) House terms …”\\n\\n50.\\n\\nHe’s in his fourth term.\\n\\n51.\\n\\n“Influence and access is everything in Washington,” he said in early 2020.\\n\\n52.\\n\\n“The reason I worked hard to be at the leadership table is because I want to help develop what that overall message is,” Johnson has said of his leadership style. “If you’re not at the leadership table you pretty much have to be a team player and go along with it.”\\n\\n53.\\n\\nHe recently led a hearing on limiting gender-affirming care. “Sex isn’t something you are assigned at birth. It is a prenatal development that occurs when every unborn child is in its mother’s womb. You can’t surgically free yourself, or someone else, from this fact of life,” he said in his opening statement. “Today, nearly one in four high school students identifies as LGBTQ. Whether it’s by scalpel or by social coercion from teachers, professors, administrators and left-wing media, it’s an attempt to transition the young people of our country. Something has gone terribly wrong …”\\n\\n54.\\n\\n“I think he’s gonna be a fantastic speaker,” Trump said Wednesday at the courthouse in New York where he’s on trial for business fraud.\\n\\n55.\\n\\n“If you don’t think that moving from Kevin McCarthy to MAGA Mike Johnson shows the ascendance of this movement and where the power in the Republican Party truly lies,” Gaetz said Wednesday morning on Steve Bannon’s podcast, “then you’re not paying attention.”',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'On Oct. 7, friends and relatives of Gali Shlezinger Idan, an Israeli who lives in a kibbutz near the border with Gaza, started getting messages to check her Facebook page. When they did, according to reporting from the New York Times’ Sheera Frenkel and Talya Minsberg, they found something horrifying: a livestream showing Idan and her family held hostage by Hamas gunmen. There is the sound of gunshots, and mortars. At one point in the 43-minute livestream, Idan tells her children something along the lines of “Stay down—I can’t lose another child today.”\\n\\nIdan’s oldest daughter was killed and her husband was taken hostage. The gunmen eventually left Idan and the two children in the video—but not before their loved ones witnessed much of the ordeal on social media.\\n\\nAs hard as it is to hear stories like this one, they are also instructive: They tell us about a new way of waging war. For as long as humans have fought each other, they’ve told stories about it—now those stories have 21st-century tools.\\n\\nOn Friday’s episode of What Next: TBD, I spoke with Frenkel, who covers tech for the Times, about Hamas’ social media strategy. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nLizzie O’Leary: When you heard about these livestreams, what did you think?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSheera Frenkel: On Oct. 7 there had been a number of Israelis who spoke to radio and TV and described seeing livestreams. I immediately kind of was like, “Livestreams? Is that possible?” When I saw it for myself, it’s shocking—Hamas gunmen were able to livestream themselves holding a family hostage for 43 minutes; in another case, they livestreamed themselves holding a family for over an hour.\\n\\nHow did the gunmen get access to the social media accounts?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThey entered the home; they asked for their cellphones and their IDs. That was the first thing they asked for. In this case, they took Gali’s cellphone, unlocked it, opened up Facebook, and began the livestream.\\n\\nLast week, I interviewed members of Hamas that had run social media for the organization in the past. Hamas has a political wing where they develop films and political campaigns for their members. So they actually have a fairly established comms team, and they described it as a very premeditated strategy meant to appeal to their supporters and show what they had done. Hamas has Facebook accounts; they could have opened up their own Facebook accounts and begun to livestream a video if they wanted to. But the decision to take the cellphone of someone they were holding hostage and use their Facebook account to livestream it was very specific and deliberate. It happened in at least four cases that we could document.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHow long did it take for the tech companies to realize this was happening and to disable these accounts?\\n\\nIn most cases, the accounts were disabled in 24 to 36 hours. Quite a while, as far the families were concerned. In one case, a young woman was taken hostage from a music festival near the Gaza border, and her Facebook account remained active for three to four days after she was taken. The family continued to get messages on it from people that they presume were holding their daughter hostage.\\n\\nYou were a Middle East reporter for 10 years, you’ve lived in Gaza, and you’ve covered previous wars in the region. Have you ever seen anything like this before?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNo. This is very much a new tactic, and we called up and spoke to people who were experts in extremist groups like Hamas. I remember ISIS pioneering the use of social media to spread their viewpoint across the world. I covered it. I was in Iraq, and I was in Syria, and their ability to use the attention economy of social media to get people to watch really horrible things—beheading videos, hostage videos—that was, at the time, unprecedented. But they had not thought of this strategy or been able to implement this strategy of hijacking the social media feeds of people you’re holding hostage. That’s something I’ve never seen before, and I think it was particularly effective in this case because so many civilians were involved.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAs you mentioned, you talked to Hamas about their social media strategy, and I’m really interested in the way they have put thought into using different platforms and how those platforms then spread messages out. Can you walk me through that?\\n\\nThe strategy they’ve come up with is they start on Telegram, which is a messaging app—and, I think it’s fair to say, has almost no content moderation. Hamas has quite a few Telegram channels in Arabic and in English, and in other languages as well, where they just seed videos and photos and slogans and messages. They’ll post a new video or photo, and then they’ll say, “Please spread this on Twitter and TikTok. … And here’s translations to other languages. If you’re French speaking, please post it with this language. If you’re Spanish speaking, post it …” It’s very cohesive and well-thought-out.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nLargely, they tell people to share on Twitter. They’ve openly commented that Twitter is very easy to post things to right now. We have to remember that when Elon Musk took control of the platform a year ago now, he fired most of the established trust and safety team, many of whom actually had experience in, specifically in Hamas, but also just in extremist organizations. When that expertise left the building, they lost a lot of their skill set in removing these accounts quickly. So Hamas tells them to go to Twitter, and they also tell them to go to TikTok and YouTube, and they even give instructions on how you can speed up the video or slow down the video or clip the video so that if those companies take down one version of it, maybe another version can live online.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHamas is supposed to be banned on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. Has that worked?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nI think that the Meta-owned companies have been very quick to take Hamas accounts down. They struggle with it, though. Hamas also operates schools; they are a political organization that informs people when power and electricity is going to be on or off. So there are Hamas pages that Facebook has really struggled with. Like, “Wait, well, if this is a page that’s letting people know when the first day of school is or when water and power will be resumed to their neighborhoods, is that something that we should be taking down?” But by and large, when something is posting graphic videos or veers into the territory of posting propaganda that’s supportive of Hamas’ military wing, they are very quick to take it down. Twitter less so. I’m still struggling to figure out TikTok because I’ve seen some videos removed within minutes, I would say, and then others that have lived there for hours, and I can’t see rhyme or reason for why some are being removed and some aren’t. I think TikTok is a little bit more whack-a-mole at the moment.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWe’ve come full circle, in a way. I’m thinking back to those ISIS videos in 2014, when content moderation was not robust. Things went up on YouTube that were horrifying. But then social media companies seemed to put a decent amount of effort and time and staffing into content moderation that helped stop some of this. At the same time, in 2019, in Christchurch, New Zealand, a far-right extremist killed 51 people in a mosque and livestreamed it on Facebook. What can the social media companies do with this, other than, as you said, play whack-a-mole?\\n\\nPlay whack-a-mole, hire ever-increasing teams to be responsive and to freeze this kind of activity when it happens. I mentioned that Facebook has been relatively quick to take this stuff down. They’ve also, since COVID, lost people from their security team and their trust and safety team, and so their teams are also smaller than they used to be.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFor Twitter, Elon Musk decimated their trust and safety team. So that’s an extreme example. But all the companies have been reducing their head count and making these teams smaller. And that makes it slower—but even if they had more people, that’s never going to be 100 percent effective.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAs you know, it’s incredibly hard to report from Gaza. Some of the social media that has come out has given people a voice, and yet that can be so easily weaponized to inflict harm. How do companies reckon with that—being a tool of information and connection, but also harm and destruction?\\n\\nIt’s one of the hardest things happening in Gaza right now. There are a lot of people who live in Gaza who depend on social media to try and find out where they’re going to get water or fuel, or where food is coming in. The U.N. provides food to over 1 million people who live in the Gaza Strip, and social media is one way that they tell one another, “Oh, the U.N. food operation center is happening here today.” Especially in a time of war, where there’s widespread bombing happening across the Gaza Strip, people are letting one another know where it’s safe to be through social media.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nYou have this deep background covering the Middle East and conflict, and also covering tech companies. How do you think the role of technology and social media has evolved in this region in the past decade?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn so many ways, what’s happening in Israel and Gaza and the West Bank is a battle of narratives. It’s been fought since the 1940s, potentially even before, of whose version of the story is the right one. Is it the version that serves the state of Israel? Is it the version that serves the Palestinian people? As the years have gone on, as the decades have gone on, each side has become really deeply entrenched in their own narrative of things. Technology, for the most part, has served that. These tech companies, specifically the social media companies, have created really deep echo chambers.\\n\\nFuture Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.',\n",

The 27-year-old, who is half-Palestinian, penned a comprehensive note in support of Palestine. She asked for forgiveness for remaining silent and claimed that her phone number was leaked and she\\'s been receiving hundreds of death threats daily, which has put her family in danger.\\n\\nBella wrote, “I can not be silenced any longer. Fear is not an option. The people and children of Palestine, especially in Gaza, cannot afford our silence. We are not brave - they are. My heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood. Seeing the aftermath from the airstrikes in Gaza, I mourn with all the mothers who have lost children and the children who cry alone, all the lost fathers, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunties, friends that will never again walk this earth. I mourn for the Israeli families that have been dealing with the pain and aftermath of October 7th.\"\\n\\n“Regardless of the history of the land, I condemn the terrorist attacks on any civilians, anywhere. Harming women and children and inflicting terror does not and should not do any good for the Free Palestine movement. I believe deep in my heart, that no child, no people anywhere, should be taken away from their family either temporarily or indefinitely. That goes for Israeli and Palestinian people alike. It\\'s important to understand the hardship of what it is to be Palestinian, in a world that sees us as nothing more than terrorists resisting peace. It is harmful, it is shameful, and its categorically untrue,” she added.\\n\\nBella emphasised that everyone must stand together to defend humanity. She also called for attention to the crisis families are facing in war zones where they urgently need food and water.\\n\\n(We are on WhatsApp. To get latest news updates, Join our Channel.

       " {'articleBody': 'Arab nations have linked hands with the Global South to challenge Israel and its western backers to end the bombing in a Gaza at the start of a rare two-day emergency debate at the UN general assembly.\\n\\nIn a fierce warning on Thursday the Iranian foreign minister said that if what he described as the genocide did not stop the US would “not be spared from this fire”.\\n\\nThe debate was occasionally unsettling for the US, as diplomats from across the globe challenged what they frequently described as Washington’s unqualified support for Israel since the Hamas attack that killed 1,400 people. Since then, according to the Palestinian authorities, more than 7,000 people have been killed in Gaza, with Israel pounding the territory with airstrikes.\\n\\nThe tone of the debate was set by its title – Illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory. A large majority of nations in the assembly will probably condemn Israel if a non-binding vote is called on Friday.\\n\\nThe smaller 15-strong UN security council, including its five permanent veto wielding members, has been unable to reach agreement on the terms of a humanitarian pause to the hostilities.\\n\\nOn Wednesday Russia and the US vetoed each other’s resolutions. The US last week also vetoed a Brazilian resolution calling for humanitarian corridors into Gaza, on the grounds that it did not assert Israel’s right to self-defence.\\n\\nA resolution passed by the security council carries more weight than one passed by the larger 193-country general assembly.\\n\\nIn a stark warning, Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said : “I say frankly to the American statesmen who are managing the genocide in Palestine that we do not welcome an expansion of the war in the region. But if the genocide in Gaza continues they will not be spared from this fire.” He insisted progress was being made to secure the release of hostages seized by Hamas.\\n\\nThe Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, said that at least 80 Palestinian families had lost 10 or more of their relatives, and sometimes up to 45 members of the same families had been killed. “How can representatives of states explain how horrible it is that 1,000 Israelis were killed, and not feel the same outrage when 1,000 Palestinians are now killed every single day?” Mansour asked.\\n\\nAyman Hussein Abdullah Al-Safadi, Jordan’s foreign minister, lambasted the language used by Israel saying “the Israeli government … called for wiping out Palestinians of the face of this Earth, called them animals unworthy of life”.\\n\\nThe Israeli ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, showed the general assembly a brief video that he said showed a Hamas fighter trying to decapitate a man with a garden tool during the attack on 7 October this year.\\n\\nErdan, who has called for the resignation of the UN secretary general, António Guterres, insisted: “This is not a war with the Palestinians. Israel is at war with the genocidal Hamas terrorist organisation … Hamas do not care about the Palestinian people. Hamas has only one goal – to annihilate Israel.”\\n\\nIn a joint statement the foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Egypt and Morocco, on Thursday condemned the targeting of civilians and violations of international law in Gaza.\\n\\nTheir statement said the right to self-defence did not justify breaking the law and neglecting Palestinians’ rights. The Arab ministers also condemned forced displacement and collective punishment of the Palestinians in Gaza.\\n\\nThey criticised Israel’s continued occupation of Palestinian areas and called for more efforts to implement a two-state solution to the decades-long conflict, an idea that has been the foundation of a long-moribund peace process.\\n\\n“The absence of a political solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has led to repeated acts of violence and suffering for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples and the peoples of the region,” it said.\\n\\nSupport for Israel came from European governments. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Friday would send a clear signal of backing for Israel in what he called its self-defence efforts.\\n\\nQatar also said its work trying to negotiate the release of hostages held by Hamas was being hampered by the continued Israeli bombardment. The Qatari foreign affairs minister, Mohammed Al Khulaifi, said: “It’s a very, very, difficult negotiation … with the bombing continuing every day, our task becomes more difficult. But despite that we remain hopeful, we remain committed.”\\n\\nAnger was also expressed at a new pitch by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. He said “the Israeli attack on Gaza … has reached the level of a massacre, and the silence of the international community on what is happening is a shame for humanity”.\\n\\nErdoğan added that peace would “only be possible with the creation of an independent, sovereign and geographically integrated, Palestinian state, according to the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital”.',\n",

Sir Ronald Storrs, governor of the so called ‘Palestine Mandate’ 1917-26, welcomed the arrival of Jewish colonists into the region after the Balfour declaration advocating a Jewish homeland.\\n\\nArabs opposed the British mandate; they’d expected independence. Indeed, the British had led them to believe they would get it after the Turkish defeat. So Storrs hoped the more Jewish colonists the better because they would “form for England a little loyal Jewish Ulster in a sea of potentially hostile Arabism”.\\n\\nThat went well, didn’t it?\\n\\nThe Arabs, in whose lands the British encouraged Jews to live, never accepted the legitimacy of the British creation or its later emanation, Israel, following little loyal Jewish Ulster’s’ revolt against British rule.

Daniel Hagari said Thursday evening that the army would continue similar limited ground raids in Gaza, saying they would be carried out “tonight as well, and it will continue all the more forcefully in the coming days.”\\n\\nHe said the IDF was still carrying out “massive strikes” on the Gaza Strip, “from the air and sea,” focusing on killing senior Hamas members and those who participated in the October 7 assault.\\n\\nThursday saw multiple salvos of rockets aimed at central Israel, including the cities of Tel Aviv, Rishon Lezion, Bat Yam, Givatayim, Ramat Gan, Holon and others, as well as barrages targeting southern cities Ashdod, Ashkelon and Netivot, as well as largely evacuated Gaza border communities.\\n\\nפגיעה בבניין בפתח תקווה pic.twitter.com/wVRNZRa4KO — בז news (@1717Bazz) October 26, 2023\\n\\nMany of the projectiles were intercepted or fell in uninhabited areas, but one damaged a building in the central city of Petah Tikva and started a fire in an eighth-floor apartment, prompting all 36 families living in the building to temporarily evacuate as officials removed the rocket, which was suspected to have not fully exploded. A woman living in the damaged apartment had headed out with her daughter minutes before the impact.\\n\\nA rocket in a later barrage at central Israel landed near a highway near Rehovot, setting fire to a utility pole.

Gen. Herzi Halevi said Tuesday that the full ground offensive into Gaza had been delayed by “tactical and even strategic considerations.”\\n\\nOn Wednesday, The New York Times reported that Israel had agreed to a request from the United States to temporarily delay the planned Gaza ground incursion to give Washington more time to deploy additional air defense systems to protect its troops in the region.\\n\\nThe US was also reportedly concerned that Israel lacks achievable military goals for its operations in Gaza, leading to fears that the IDF is not yet ready for a ground incursion.\\n\\nThe campaign is also understood to have been postponed to allow for extensive internationally brokered negotiations with Hamas over the potential release of hundreds of Israeli and foreign hostages it is holding. Talks have resulted in four captives being freed — mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Ra’anan on Friday night, and elderly women Yocheved Lifshitz and Nurit Cooper on Monday night.\\n\\nThe negotiations have also resulted in a trickle of humanitarian aid entering Gaza for its besieged and devastated civilian population. Twelve aid trucks entered Gaza on Thursday, bringing food, water and medicine, according to Rafah border crossing officials and the Palestine Red Crescent Society, bringing the total number of trucks to have entered the Strip in recent days to 74.\\n\\nHebrew media reports on Thursday evening suggested that Israel was considering allowing fuel to enter Gaza via Egypt as part of a deal that would see Hamas free many captives. But Hagari, the IDF spokesman, said that “at this point, the instruction of the political echelon is that no fuel is entering. If there is a change, we will update the public.”\\n\\nHagari added that a great deal of Hamas’s ability to operate “relies on fuel,” repeating the claim that the terror group is stealing and stockpiling fuel that could go to hospitals.\\n\\nHamas made an unverified claim Thursday that “almost 50” Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip had been killed by Israeli airstrikes. There was no independent verification, and Israel has not reacted to such claims in the past. The terror group frequently fabricates such statements and is engaged in psychological warfare against the families of the hostages as well as the general population.\\n\\n“Izz ad-Din Al-Qassam Brigades estimates that the number of Zionist prisoners who were killed in the Gaza Strip as a result of Zionist strikes and massacres has reached almost 50,” the terror group said in a statement on its Telegram channel.\\n\\nAn IDF official said separately on Thursday that a portion of the weapons used by Hamas in its October 7 onslaught were manufactured in Iran or North Korea.\\n\\nThe military official made the statement during an official media tour in which it displayed a variety of weapons recovered from communities in southern Israel attacked by the terrorists.\\n\\nA range of landmines, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), and homemade drones were part of the haul displayed.\\n\\nPart of the arsenal included Iranian-made mortar rounds and North Korean RPGs.\\n\\n“I think about five to 10 percent of the weapons here [were] made in Iran, and 10 percent [are] North Korean. The rest of it was made inside the Gaza Strip,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\\n\\n“I think the most surprising thing was the amount of weapons that they brought inside Israel,” the official said.\\n\\nTimes of Israel staff and agencies contributed to this report.\",\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Nawaz Sharif is back and full of fire even at 73. His first speech at the Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore was quite astonishing in some respects even as he quietly avoided the issues he had been fulminating about in London. It seems a bargain has been made with multiple actors, not just the army. All of this is interesting not because a politician has come back to his country, but because Pakistan itself has changed almost beyond all recognition in terms of the drivers that are propelling it.\\n\\nFirst, the fact that Sharif was able to return on the say-so of the army is obvious to all. The army-led National Accountability Bureau did not oppose the Islamabad High Court’s decision to provide protective bail for Sharif on two of the most critical cases: one involving the acquisition of no less than four flats in London, for which the family was unable to account and another concerning the source of funds to set up Al-Azizia Steel Mills and Hill Metal Establishment (HME) in Saudi Arabia. A third arrest warrant was also suspended in the Toshakhana case (where Imran was caught on shaky ground). The point is that there is a clutch of other cases, including one on a sugar mill, all of which means that the former premier is shackled by the leg with no certainty that he will even be allowed to compete. That is point one.\\n\\nSecond, look at the massive crowds that greeted him. That should at all events prove that the party apparatus is alive and well on the ground. And that the grand old party has its funds intact. This is South Asia. Don’t run away with the idea that he is a popular phenomenon that will translate automatically into votes. The last Gallup poll shows him trailing at 35 per cent, way behind Imran Khan at 60 per cent. But the latter has pulled down the army more than any leader alive or dead; and that section of the population, which is the educated middle class and the youth, are unlikely to drift to Sharif for a decisive win. That means he’s going to need a coalition partner.\\n\\nLook who’s a rung above him in the popularity polls.\\n\\nSaad Rizvi, a figure of the religious right who gained prominence on the blasphemy issue and serves as the political representative of the Barelvi community among the masses. Abdul Basit analyses his rise due to repeated surrenders by the parties in power, his ability to broaden his base to include inflation and food shortages and his involvement in relief activities – for which he seems to have no lack of money – and crucially, in mobilising the Barelvi vote due to the frequent terrorist attacks against it. In recent days, TLP (Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan) has drawn massive crowds in pro-Palestine protests, further enhancing its popularity. It may be recalled that Sharif has teamed up with the religious right before, but TLP has been used by the army against Nawaz in the past, – with a video showing a senior military official distributing money to the protesters going viral. True, politicians often form alliances with unlikely partners, but any collaboration with a radical group would further limit his room for manoeuvre, a situation that would be completely favourable for the army. That’s point two.\\n\\nThen there’s the content of his speech. Not a word against the army, which is unsurprising. Even a toddler would know that ‘hybrid’ is out of the window, and the army is in the chair, and there it will stay. Therefore, only oblique references to why he was removed from power – including the very real fact that the only proven charge against him was on accepting undeclared pay from his son’s firm – and a clear statement that he has not come for revenge. There was pathos in his cry that he was not allowed to visit his dying wife. The most surprising thing was the call to repair relations with India noting without exaggeration, that even Bangladesh, once part of Pakistan, was far ahead in economic terms. The obvious fact is that Pakistan cannot in truth, remain in a state of confrontation with India, and expect to get investments, not even from ‘brotherly’ countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE both of whom have already invested to an extent in the country in recent months. But the Saudis have promised some $25 billion in investments.\\n\\nNot surprising therefore that Sharif went first to Saudi Arabia and UAE before arriving in Pakistan. Prince Mohammad Bin Sultan for one, is a shrewd businessman looking to diversify away from fossil fuels. Wars, and such like have no place in his scheme of things, or that of the others in the Muslim world, or even China. The message overall to Pakistan seems to be to get its act together, or else.\\n\\nThe trouble is that this is a terrible time to be prime minister. With a sinking economy – around $7.3 trillion in debt servicing in FY24, which is more than 50 per cent of the budget – there are few choices ahead. Gas prices are due to go up 193 per cent, which will very likely create popular unrest. Combine this with a 58 million plus youth bulge (about 13 per cent of the total population) that has been fed with tales of a ‘corrupt’ politician and the benign army. It is no accident that 88 per cent of those polled, approve of the army. All of that makes for a terrible combination for Nawaz, especially since he is likely to continue to be in the back seat for a while, with brother Shahbaz playing proxy, and balancing unlikely allies, and with a dozen cases hanging fire, there is only trouble ahead.\\n\\nHere’s the key aspect though. The only thing he can deliver, and quickly, with little cost, is to open up trade with India. That will bring down inflation and potentially, provide a huge source of income in cross-border trade across Afghanistan, Central Asia and beyond. That is what will ultimately sell, not Sharif’s personal tragedies. As inflation is likely to spiral even further, no one is going to even remember. Therefore the lesson is this. Every disaster carries an opportunity. And ironically Pakistan’s near collapse could be the driver for a revolutionary turnaround, not just in the economy, but in how Pakistan positions itself in the world. That might well be Sharif’s lasting legacy for his country, provided the khakis see sense. Already the army chief is making plans for a ‘cutting edge’ air force even while overseeing Exercise Indus Shield that incorporates 14 nations including China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and UAE. So no, there’s no evidence of that yet. Which is what will make India pause. First the evidence, then the direction.\\n\\nThe writer is a Distinguished Fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, New Delhi. She tweets @kartha_tara.

These were around three feet wide and used to haul goods along the sandy tunnel floors in hollowed-out petrol barrels.\\n\\nIn 2007, Hamas is thought to have brought its commander Mohammed Deif into Gaza through a tunnel from Egypt.

Full stop.\"\\n\\nHe did not mention the Palestinian people.\\n\\nAddressing reporters before departing for the Middle East on Oct. 11, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the top objective of his trip was a robust show of solidarity with Israel, including providing all the military equipment that it needs to defend itself.\\n\\n\"The United States has Israel\\'s back,\" Blinken said. He didn\\'t mention humanitarian aid at all.\\n\\nDuring Blinken\\'s six-day trip, the death number in Gaza soared from Israeli air strikes and concerns grew about food and water. Every Arab leader Blinken met in the region pressed him to urgently find a solution to the rapidly deteriorating situation in Gaza.\\n\\nBlinken relayed the concerns of Arab leaders, while others spoke to the U.S. president directly.\\n\\nThe intense protests against Israel that followed last week\\'s blast at a Palestinian hospital, which the United States and Israel both blamed on Palestinian operatives, also alarmed U.S. officials.\\n\\nThe protests were reminders of the risks of escalation during any ground assault, U.S. officials said, because they show how Israel\\'s adversaries could seek to wield disinformation to spark unrest.\\n\\nHUMANITARIAN PAUSE\\n\\nThe most rapid shift in U.S. policy has happened this week, to support a cessation in Israel\\'s attacks on Gaza to allow aid in and people to escape.\\n\\nAsked on Oct. 23 about international demands for a humanitarian pause, White House security spokesman John Kirby said the United States wants to make sure \"Israel has the tools it needs to defend itself and to go after Hamas and that humanitarian assistance keeps flowing.\"\\n\\nA day later, Kirby and Blinken advocated for one publicly. The shift followed a plea from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for civilians to be protected and increasingly desperate appeals from U.N. organizations to allow in aid.\\n\\nThe U.S. revised its own U.N. resolution from a focus on Israel\\'s right to defend itself to include calls for all measures, specifically to include humanitarian pauses, to allow unhindered humanitarian access of aid.\\n\\nRemarks made by Biden on Wednesday are in contrast with those on Oct. 7, and show a new direction. \"Israel has to do everything in its power, as difficult as it is, to protect innocent civilians,\" Biden told a press conference.\\n\\nHe offered a rare criticism as well of Israel\\'s \"extremist settlers\" on the West Bank, accusing them of pouring gasoline on a fire, and called for a “concentrated effort,” once the crisis is over, to work toward an accord under which Israel and a new Palestinian state would exist side-by-side in peace.\\n\\nBut Biden also expressed skepticism toward Palestinian estimates of the death number and a continued staunch support of Israel. He told the press conference that he had \"no confidence\" in the numbers the Palestinians were using about Gaza\\'s dead.\\n\\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\\n\\nAMY GOODMAN: The death toll in Gaza has topped 6,500 as Israel continues to bombard the besieged territory for a 19th day. According to Palestinian health authorities, the dead include 2,700 children.\\n\\nIsrael, with the backing of the United States, has rejected calls for a ceasefire. On Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres addressed the U.N. Security Council and called for a ceasefire.\\n\\nSECRETARY-GENERAL ANTÓNIO GUTERRES: It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. They have seen their lands steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence, their economy stifled, their people displaced and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing. But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas, and those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.\\n\\nAMY GOODMAN: Israel condemned Guterres’s comments and has vowed to stop issuing visas to U.N. representatives. Israel’s ambassador to the U.N. is also calling for Guterres’s resignation.\\n\\nThis all comes as the humanitarian situation in Gaza grows worse by the hour, as dwindling fuel supplies could soon force the closure of all hospitals in the territory. Israel is also continuing to carry out attacks on the occupied West Bank. An Israeli drone strike on the Jenin refugee camp has killed at least three Palestinians. Israeli security forces and settlers have killed at least a hundred Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since October 7th. And even before that, this was the deadliest year for Palestinians, at least one killed a day in the West Bank. Meanwhile, the number of Palestinians jailed by Israel has doubled over the past two weeks, from about 5,000 to 10,000.\\n\\nIn other developments, the prime minister of Qatar says he hopes there will be a breakthrough soon on the Israeli hostages being held by Gaza. Hamas and other groups are believed to be holding about 220 people seized on October 7th in the Hamas attack that left around 1,400 people dead in Israel.\\n\\nWe begin today’s show in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, where we’re joined by Budour Hassan, Amnesty International researcher on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Amnesty International published a report last week headlined “Damning evidence of war crimes as Israeli attacks wipe out entire families in Gaza.”\\n\\nBudour, welcome back to Democracy Now! Can you lay out your findings?\\n\\nBUDOUR HASSAN: A hello, Amy, to you, to Juan and to all listeners and viewers.\\n\\nWith the help of our field worker who is based in Gaza and testimonies that we gathered from witnesses, victims and relatives, in addition to open-source evidence and photographs examined by our evidence lab team, we found out that Israeli forces carried out indiscriminate attacks, killing and injuring civilians, and in some cases that we documented, and that barely scratch the surface of the horror that is unfolding in Gaza, entire families were wiped out during this bombing campaign, which is only escalating. In addition to indiscriminate attacks by Israeli forces, we also documented the ongoing use of collective punishment, which is a war crime, that even where Israel alleged that there was a military target, a legitimate military target, the attacks failed to abide by the principle of proportionality.\\n\\nAnd just, Amy, to go further, because we keep hearing numbers, and sometimes we may be desensitized and even inured to the extent of horror that we are witnessing, that behind each of these number there are stories. So, as part of our work, Amnesty International researchers have been listening to testimonies of people in Gaza, of victims, talking directly to people over the phone. And when we talk to people — for example, we talked to Tahir al-Zaizi [phon.], who lost 26 members of his family. All of his family were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Deir el-Balah. Tahir al-Zaizi’s two children, aged 8 and 6, were among those killed — his mother, his father, his brothers, his nieces, everyone of his family. And when we talked to him, he simply said, “You know, in my heart, there is no room for all of this.” And he started reciting the names, ages of his relatives lost. And I was reminded by Scholastique Mukasonga, the Rwandan writer, when she was remembering her loved ones who were killed in the Rwandan genocide and said that “They are all killed. No one has remained.” And this is exactly what happened to Tahir.\\n\\nAnother father we talked to, when we talked to him over the phone, he was removing rubble with his own hands, because bulldozers couldn’t make it to the neighborhood. And there are no — bulldozers can’t even make it because there is no fuel to power bulldozers and to remove the rubble. So he was left with trying to remove the rubble and to excavate the shreds of his daughter. And then, while we were with him on the phone, someone told him, “We found the toe of your little daughter.” And he started kissing her toe. This is the only thing that was left to him from her. We talked to people who don’t even have photographs to remember their loved ones with. They only have rubble, because their phones, their laptops were all destroyed in airstrikes.\\n\\nWe also talked to relatives of the family of al-Dos in al-Zeitoun neighborhood in Gaza City. Fifteen members of this family were killed in an Israeli airstrike on the first day of the bombings on the 7th of October, including a 12-year-old named Awni al-Dos. We did not realize at the time that Awni was a talented gamer and YouTuber. Only later did it emerge from his friends that one of his dreams was to have more than 100,000 subscribers on YouTube, which he will never see. And these are just some of the faces.\\n\\nRight now, as we speak, people in Gaza have not been able to mourn or to grieve properly. There are no funerals for the dead. It’s very hard. There are more than 1,000 bodies buried under the rubble, and people cannot get. Even when people manage to bury their loved ones, they just bury remnants. And even when they share with us testimonies, with the difficulty of getting to people, what they share with us almost are fragments of testimonies, not really testimonies, because of the devastation that they’re living through and because simply they say, “We need time to at least think about mourning our loved ones, about reflecting on all that we’ve been going through.” And with this incessant bombings and war, they don’t even have time for that.\\n\\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Budour, I wanted to ask you: What did your report find about the Israeli military warning civilians before dropping these bombs or missile attacks? And also, Israel has claimed that the people of Gaza should move out of northern Gaza into the south. But what are you finding about attacks in the south?\\n\\nAMY GOODMAN: Budour? We’re talking to Budour Hassan, who is Amnesty International researcher on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. We’re having a bit of a sound issue. Amnesty International has published a new report headlined “Damning evidence of war crimes as Israeli attacks wipe out entire families in Gaza.” Go ahead with what you were saying, Budour.\\n\\nWhy don’t we turn to a clip as we fix the sound with Budour Hassan? More than half of Gaza’s population has been displaced by the Israeli assault. This is an 18-year-old Palestinian named Dima Allamdani. She had fled to southern Gaza after Israel ordered Palestinians to leave their homes in the north. Much of her family died in an Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, where the family had sought temporary shelter.\\n\\nDIMA ALLAMDANI: [translated] I went to look for my mother, my father and my siblings at the morgue. At first they told me, “Come, see your mother.” They didn’t show me her face, but I recognized her from what she has on her feet. God bless her soul. I felt heartbroken. It was like a nightmare. They opened my father’s coffin, and he had no signs of injuries, but he died. God bless his soul. I had a 16-year-old sister among the dead, and they wrote my name on her coffin since they thought it was me. Her body didn’t have any signs of injuries, but maybe she died from internal injuries. … They also showed me my little sister. She’s in first grade. And they asked me, “Who is she?” At first I didn’t recognize her due to all the cuts and burns on her face. Then they wrote her name on her coffin. I would have never thought that my family would end up like this. I felt heartbroken. It’s a nightmare. I can’t believe it, until now, that they’re all dead, no one left.\\n\\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I think we have the connection straightened out with Budour Hassan. I was asking you, Budour, about the Israeli warnings to civilians before attacks, what you’ve learned about that, and also about the Israeli claim that the Palestinians of northern Gaza should move to the south for safety.\\n\\nBUDOUR HASSAN: Juan, in the majority of cases that we did document, there were no warnings before the airstrikes, so the families did not receive at all any warnings. Even in cases where there was advance warning, that advance warning was not effective, because it was only informed to one of the family members, not to the entire family or the residents of the buildings. And it failed to meet the standards that require to make a warning effective, with no clear timeframe.\\n\\nWith regards to the warning, the initial warning by the Israeli army issued on the 13th of October for all of the residents of north of Wadi Gaza to evacuate to south of Wadi Gaza, this amounts to a forced displacement, simply because this is unfeasible for this community to leave. They cannot leave. Obviously, there are thousands of people with disabilities, wounded people. This number of people simply do not have the means and cannot leave. And then that was later followed by leaflets dropped by the Israeli army warning people to leave and then saying that anyone who chooses to stay north of Wadi Gaza will be considered accomplice with armed terrorist organizations, as per the words of the army, which again amounts to collective punishment, fails to meet the principle of distinction, because an entire area, hundreds of thousands, nearly a million people are treated just like an open fire zone, which also signals that the Israeli army intends to not distinguish between civilians and military target, because an entire area is transformed into one.\\n\\nAnd even if we support that many of these people were to leave, the situation in southern Gaza, and especially in Rafah and Khan Younis, is particularly dire. The UNRWA-run schools are barely — they’re not capable of dealing with the amount of people, the influx of people into south Gaza, in addition to the incessant bombardment also targeting areas in southern Gaza, especially over the last five days. So, these coercive conditions in which the Israeli army is trying to force people out, which, again, amount to forced displacement, knowing that people in Gaza absolutely have nowhere safe from bombardment and airstrikes.\\n\\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to ask you about the West Bank. That’s where you are right now, Budour. You’re in Ramallah. In the occupied West Bank, health officials say at least a hundred Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces and armed settlers amidst mounting military raids and arrests. The Israeli human rights group B’Tselem has documented some of the attacks. In one video shared online, an Israeli settler, accompanied by an Israeli soldier, shoots a man at point-blank range. Major protests also across the West Bank have taken aim at the ruling Palestinian Authority, which has launched a violent crackdown on demonstrations. Last week, a 12-year-old Palestinian girl named Razan Nasrallah was shot and killed by PA security forces during protests in Jenin following the deadly bombing of Gaza’s Al-Ahli Hospital. Still not clear what that explosion — who was responsible for that explosion. But, Budour, if you can talk about what’s happening also with Gazans who had work permits in the occupied West Bank, what has happened to them, and what’s happening in the prisons, where thousands of Palestinians are held?\\n\\nBUDOUR HASSAN: Since the 7th of October, after the Hamas attack, thousands of workers from Gaza who had valid work permits to work in Israel and the occupied West Bank had their work permits unilaterally revoked. So, they could only learn about that through an application. And then Israeli forces started rounding them up and detaining them in military bases in cage-like conditions. One prisoner who was later released, because he was actually a resident of the West Bank, spoke about torture and other ill-treatment to which these workers are subjected. Families of workers who contacted Israeli human rights organizations, including HaMoked, Gisha and Physicians for Human Rights, said that they have no clue where their family members are. So, Israel now is treating — is arbitrarily detaining thousands of Palestinian workers, almost treating them like hostages, denying them due process, denying them meetings with lawyers. There is not even a hint of due process, in addition to torture.\\n\\nAll that in the context of increasing numbers of detentions, and before that, before all of this started, the number of Palestinians administratively detained without charges or trial has hit a 20-year high. And the number has doubled just since the 7th of October. And Palestinian families obviously have not been able to visit their loved ones in prison. In addition to that, the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, adopted an amendment that would authorize the Israeli prison authorities to not limit the number of people who can be detained in one cell, which has made the conditions of imprisonment absolutely dire and amounting to torture and other ill-treatment.\\n\\nAll of that, Amy, as you said, in the context of increasing number of unlawful killings of Palestinians, including Palestinian children, mostly during protests, and many of these cases where state-supported settlers have also been rampaging across the West Bank, leading to unprecedented levels of forcible transfer in areas around Ramallah. And unfortunately, this level of pressure, of coercion, of oppression that Palestinians have been facing in the West Bank, which is part and parcels of Israel’s apartheid regime, has received such a scant attention, because all eyes now are on Gaza, which has given the opportunity to Israeli settlers and to Israeli policymakers to actually escalate their campaign of forcible transfer and of settlement expansion.\\n\\nAMY GOODMAN: Budour Hassan, we want to thank you so much for being with us, Amnesty International researcher on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Again, we will link to Amnesty’s report headlined “Damning evidence of war crimes as Israeli attacks wipe out entire families in Gaza.”\\n\\nWhen we come back, we speak with the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Viet Thanh Nguyen about his new memoir, A Man of Two Faces: A Memoir, a History, a Memorial. A major talk in New York was canceled after he signed, along with hundreds and hundreds of writers, a letter calling for a ceasefire. Stay with us.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Gurjit Singh\\n\\nFormer Ambassador\\n\\nTHE arrival of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Washington on Thursday has raised hopes of a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping during the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit to be held in San Francisco next month.\\n\\nThe G20 summit in New Delhi had witnessed a meeting between Biden and Chinese Premier Li Qiang, even as Xi chose to skip the event. Weeks later, the world was rocked by the conflict in West Asia.\\n\\nChina hosted the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) summit on October 17-18, while holding out the promise of a Xi-Biden meeting on the sidelines of the APEC summit, but putting forth its conditions quite clearly.\\n\\nChina acknowledges that there are many differences with the US, but these can be bridged if a commonality is worked out. As always, the Chinese are looking for ‘mutual respect’ among their core interests.\\n\\nChina wants the US to back off on Taiwan, as it perceives that the US is mobilising Japan, the Philippines and Australia to robustly challenge it. Beijing also wants that the issues of democracy and human rights should not be raised by the US. China is keen that its path to development within its economic and political order should not be unduly criticised or impeded by America and its allies. It decries sanctions on hi-tech exports by the US, and the encouragement to decoupling and ‘China plus one’ policies. China also wants to avoid the ‘autocracy vs democracy’ debate.\\n\\nWhat does it offer in return? It offers the possibility of a G2 management of the world since it has Russia firmly behind it. If it gets that G2 opportunity, it promises to offer a constructive and cooperative relationship with the US. Meanwhile, it has imposed curbs on graphite exports to counter the US move to inhibit technology exports to China.\\n\\nChina, it seems, is seeking a panda moment again in its ties with the US. Some of the pandas gifted to the US around 1972 are scheduled to return to China in December this year, but if a Xi-Biden summit is held in November, new pandas may actually come to the US and bring new green shoots.\\n\\nThere is no indication that the US would accept these Chinese terms. The crisis in West Asia has brought instability well beyond Ukraine and Taiwan, which the US is scrounging to control. This is because the Israeli factor has a strong domestic dimension in the US. Yet, Israeli actions have the potential of undoing the Abraham Accords and the consequent economic progress through peace under the West Asia plan.\\n\\nThis is where China’s West Asia interests come into play. China has been creating an alternative alliance with Russia and Iran, whose main aim is to destabilise American policies. Since Iran isn’t in the US-brokered Accords, this could mean adopting an anti-Israel attitude and provoking an Arab reaction against Israel where feasible. The quick pace of the Accords and the speed with which Saudi Arabia was moving towards a rapprochement with Israel was unsettling for the perceived loss of influence for China. China invested considerably in the Saudi-Iran rapprochement in March this year. Saudi Arabian embrace of Israel is impacting Chinese interests.\\n\\nTherefore, the Hamas attack against Israel, whether provoked by Iran, China or others, is manna from heaven for the Chinese policy in West Asia. Neither China nor Russia has condemned Hamas, but they continue to criticise Israel for its Palestinian policy. Given China’s influence with Iran, it is noticeable that the US has not directly blamed Iran for the Hamas strikes. This is to keep the pot boiling and allowing China leeway in the region.\\n\\nThe Chinese aim is to exploit the situation to side with Hamas and Arab nations. It hopes to find a role as a mediator in West Asia, which is actually an arena of US policy preferences. The China-Russia-Iran axis will work towards this end. Zhai Jun, China’s special envoy to West Asia, met Mikhail Bogdanov, the Russian President’s special representative for West Asia and Africa, in Qatar last week and enunciated this strategy.\\n\\nCondemning Israel, not criticising Hamas, fostering Arab unity and resumption of peace talks between Palestine and Israel for a two-state solution, preferably facilitated by China, are the objectives. A bigger Chinese role will be a reduction of the US influence, and hence Washington may seek a cooperative complementary effort with China to address the Israeli quagmire.\\n\\nAfter Biden’s less-than-successful visit to Israel and sensing the anguish of the Arabs, it will perhaps become clear to the Americans that to safeguard their West Asia policy, they may have to work more closely with China. Perhaps that will prevent Saudi Arabia from ditching Israel firmly and not give Iran avenues to further destabilise the region. Managing these two could have a Chinese role.\\n\\nThe recent expansion of BRICS is proving useful for China. South Africa is better aligned with China’s West Asia policy. Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt and the UAE are now part of BRICS. China is working with each of them to build a place for itself. However, at the BRI summit, the only senior Arab leaders were the Egyptian PM and the UAE’s special representative.\\n\\nThe China-Arab summit in December 2022 mentioned the Arab countries as a new strategic pillar of multilateral partnership for China. China views this as an instance of South-South cooperation and a part of building communities with a shared future. The emergence of a cooperation system has energy cooperation at the core and includes infrastructure, trade and investment. It seeks to utilise technologies related to nuclear energy, space and new energy as elements of cooperation.\\n\\nAfter its Saudi-Iran initiative, China now has the opportunity to extend its influence in the region amid the Israel-Hamas war.\\n\\n#China #G20 #Joe Biden #United States of America USA #Washington #Xi Jinping',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'The Middle East could be on the verge of a regional conflagration. That’s in stark contrast to the atmosphere of just a few weeks ago, when the Biden administration was working on sealing a historic deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel that it hoped would stabilize a region long convulsed by war and sectarianism.\\n\\nNow, in the wake of Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, Israel appears to be preparing to invade Gaza. Israeli forces and the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah are firing at each other at the Lebanon border. Protests have erupted in cities across the region. The United States has moved two carrier strike groups into the eastern Mediterranean, and on Thursday a Navy warship shot down missiles and drones from Yemen that the military says may have been headed toward Israel. In a sign that the Pentagon expects similar attacks in the days ahead, on Saturday the U.S. military said it would increase its missile defense capability in the region to help protect U.S. forces.\\n\\nAt the center of these mounting tensions is Iran, which has been engaged in a shadow war with its chief regional rival, Israel, for years. On Oct. 10, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, applauded the deadly terrorist attack by Hamas, which is part of a loose network of nonstate armed groups that Iran uses to bolster its influence in the region. Tehran has denied any involvement in the attack, and Israeli and American officials acknowledge that there is no “direct evidence” proving otherwise. But as Iran rages over the ever-mounting casualties in Gaza and what it perceives as America’s interference, fears are growing that this on-again-off-again proxy war, waged through Hamas in the south and Hezbollah in the north, will break out into a sustained conflict, potentially even dragging in the United States.\\n\\nIran may not have ordered Hamas’s attack, but government officials in Washington believe Tehran bears responsibility for enabling Hamas to gain the military capability and expertise to carry out the complex attack that has killed at least 1,400 Israelis and captured some 200 hostages. Days after the attack, Washington and Doha, Qatar, announced that Tehran would be denied access to $6 billion that had been recently unfrozen as a result of a prisoner swap between the United States and Iran.\\n\\nEach year, Iran doles out hundreds of millions of dollars to improve the combat effectiveness of Hezbollah, Hamas and other militant groups in the region, including the Houthis in Yemen and an assortment of Iraqi Shia militias. With that funding, the groups, which Tehran has supported for decades as part of its “axis of resistance,” have developed an extensive assortment of capabilities, ranging from unmanned aerial systems to high-end ballistic missile arsenals that would be the envy of most national militaries.\\n\\nTraining and equipping terrorists, insurgents and militias is a core element of Iran’s foreign and security policy in the Middle East. At the vanguard of this effort is the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps-Quds Force, an elite unit responsible for conducting covert activities, including the sponsorship of groups like Hamas. IRGC-QF trainers and advisers provide hands-on instruction to militants on how to plan ambushes, improve operational security and gain proficiency with emerging technologies and cutting-edge weapons systems. The success of this training was evident in the way Hamas used drones to knock out the Israel Defense Force’s cellular communications and surveillance towers along the border with Gaza in its recent attack.\\n\\nIran uses proxy forces to advance its national security objectives: pushing adversaries like the United States, which has more than 30,000 troops stationed across various facilities in the Middle East, out of the region and expanding its own sphere of influence without generating a direct military response from rivals. Proxy forces allow Tehran to meddle in ongoing conflicts in the background, maintaining a thin veneer of deniability and avoiding being pulled into a direct military confrontation with militarily superior foes — namely, Israel and the United States. It also gives Tehran leverage as its proxy groups develop political wings, helping Iran play kingmaker in local and national politics in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere.\\n\\nThese proxy-war tactics have been a success. Hamas and Hezbollah have inflicted serious damage in Israel without bringing the war home to Iran and have sent a clear message to Jerusalem that Tehran, if it wants to, is able to wage a campaign of asymmetric warfare that combines conventional and unconventional military capabilities.\\n\\nBut that paradigm may be about to change.\\n\\nMany longtime Middle East watchers believe that the driving force behind Hamas’s attack was an overarching imperative — from both Hamas leadership and Tehran — to disrupt the momentum of the normalization agreement between Israel and Iran’s other longtime nemesis in the region, Saudi Arabia. And it may have worked. The images of death and destruction coming out of Gaza and the mounting death toll of Palestinian civilians could ultimately prove to be too much for Saudi Arabia to ignore. For the time being, any normalization talks between Saudi Arabia and Israel have been shelved.\\n\\nBut Tehran has gone much further than disrupting talks. The IRGC-QF commander, Gen. Ismail Qaani, appears to be coordinating Iran’s various proxy forces more closely, even reportedly organizing regular meetings since August between the heads of Hezbollah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group that is active in Gaza. Accordingly, the fighting since Oct. 7 has not been limited to Gaza. Israel has launched strikes into Lebanon in response to Hezbollah missiles that have been fired into its territory. The exchange so far has followed a long-running pattern of tit-for-tat reprisals. Still, Israel, concerned that Hezbollah fighters may be preparing to ramp up attacks and launch a sustained offensive in response to an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza, has announced the evacuation of more than two dozen communities along its border with Lebanon, including one small city of some 20,000 residents.\\n\\nAs the conflict intensifies, there are growing concerns that Israel may be headed toward a more direct confrontation with Iran. U.S. military stationed in the region have also faced threats from Iran-backed groups in recent days. On Oct. 17, after scores of Palestinians were killed in a hospital bombing, Ayatollah Khamenei accused the United States of fomenting the chaos that is threatening to envelop the region, taking to X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter: “The Zionist regime’s policy is being regulated by the Americans,” he said. “The U.S. is responsible for the recent crimes.”\\n\\nAnd while the Biden administration provided evidence, based on the intelligence it has seen, that the hospital strike was an errant Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket, the fuse has already been lit, with protests continuing throughout the region. Protesters tried to storm the Israeli Embassy in Amman, Jordan, and violent demonstrators targeted the Israeli consulate in Istanbul.\\n\\nIf Hezbollah decides to take advantage of the overstretched Israel Defense Forces and officially open up a second front on Israel’s northern border, the situation could escalate — and deteriorate — quickly. Even the slightest miscalculation by Iran or one of its proxies could result in a dramatic response by the Israelis, potentially pulling in the United States and setting the stage for a bitter regional conflict.\\n\\nColin P.

The U.S. suspects that Iran-backed groups such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah are behind the attacks. Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said at the U.N. on Thursday that the U.S. will “not be spared from this fire” if Israel’s offensive against Hamas does not stop.\\n\\nThe U.S. military carried out strikes on Thursday against two facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and groups it supports, the Pentagon said. “These precision self-defence strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on October 17,” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement.\\n\\n“These Iranian-backed attacks against U.S. forces are unacceptable and must stop,” Austin said. Biden has sent a rare message to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warning Tehran against targeting U.S. personnel in the Middle East, the White House said earlier on Thursday.\\n\\nIsrael said on Friday that it was preparing “the next stage of the operation” in Gaza, amid fears that a ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave could spark a wider Middle East conflict. Israel has pounded the densely populated Gaza Strip following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israeli communities. Israel says Hamas killed some 1,400 people including children, and took more than 200 hostages, some of them infants and older adults.\\n\\nThe Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry said on Thursday that 7,028 Palestinians had been killed in the retaliatory air strikes, including 2,913 children. A missile launched as part of fighting between Hamas and Israel struck an Egyptian resort town about 220 km (135 miles) from the Gaza Strip early on Friday, Egypt’s Al Qahera News reported, citing sources.\\n\\nThe missile hit a medical facility in Taba, injuring at least six people, Al Qahera TV reported. A witness in Taba confirmed hearing an explosion and seeing smoke rising, but Reuters was not immediately able to identify the blast’s source. Taba is located on Egypt’s border with Israel’s Red Sea port of Eilat. Israel’s military said it was aware of a security incident outside its borders.\\n\\nIsrael said on Friday that its fighter jets had struck three senior Hamas operatives in the Daraj Tuffah Battalion, part of the Gaza City Brigade. Israel said the three commanders had played a significant role in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\\n\\nThere was no official announcement by Hamas. Palestinian militants clashed with Israeli troops in at least two areas of the Gaza Strip on Friday, Hamas-affiliated media reported.\\n\\nIsraeli military vehicles raided the central area of Al-Bureij and troops were clashing with militants near the border there, the reports said. In the south, in a border area near the town of Rafah, Hamas militants were trading fire with Israeli troops, according to the reports.\\n\\nAs the plight of Palestinian civilians grows more desperate, the issue of whether to have humanitarian pauses or ceasefire agreements in the Hamas-run coastal enclave will come before the 193-member U.N. General Assembly on Friday in a draft resolution submitted by Arab states calling for a ceasefire.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'For those who have been going red in the face arguing for the need to stamp out offensive, derogatory, and defamatory posts online, the Gaza War has confirmed that the monster known as social media has tipped us into the abyss. There is no coming back from a situation wherein a grandmother’s murder by Hamas terrorists was photographed by her executioners and posted to her Facebook account. The brutal, inhumane video appeared on her grandson’s Facebook ‘news feed’ and on that of her friends and family members because it was uploaded from her own account. Is this an extreme example of the grotesqueness of social media?\\n\\nOf course. But after two decades of allowing impunity to those who get away with targeting individuals with violent threats and virulent allegations, nobody should be surprised that extremists are using this template for their own ends. That the information war is such a critical aspect of 21st century armed conflict makes disinformation an integral part of military operations. In the case of the Israeli grandmother, Facebook algorithms deployed to spot violent content that appears on sites run by extremists could not prevent the photos from being uploaded because ordinary people with no history of posting violent videos were obviously not part of the metric.\\n\\nIt bears keeping in mind that it is so-called ordinary people who, historically, have done the most damage. As Darrell West of the Brookings Institute writes in a recent article, the tragedy of the elderly Israeli woman reveals the challenges facing social media platforms during times of conflict. Tech companies, he adds, are going to have to figure out how to identify violent content and remove it before it reaches thousands or millions of people. If it takes Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Telegram et.al. hours to take down such material, as is usually the case unless one has the money to pay humungous legal fees for top lawyers to appear at the drop of a hat, terror organisations are guaranteed large numbers of viewers for their barbaric and inhumane actions.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRealistically, it is too late to do anything but write about this phenomenon for posterity to take note. Because whether it is individuals airing fantastic conspiracy theories online without fear of sanction or terrorist organisations posting brutal murders, they have broader strategic goals to achieve. All of them need to document their actions and push them out to large numbers of viewers. In that way, they can pressurise individuals in decision-making positions and terrorise innocent civilians around the world. Social media platforms not only allow but effectively encourage this; algorithms cannot measure motives and distinguish posts meant legitimately to inform versus those designed to inflame and/or defame.

       " {'articleBody': 'Away from the theatre of the Israel-Hamas war in West Asia and far away from Canada whose government’s soft stand towards the Khalistanis is troubling India, a new development in Bhutan’s foreign relations has become India’s latest worry due to its far-reaching implications for India’s security. Bhutan, a small Kingdom tucked away in the lap of the mighty Himalayas has been taking baby steps towards global outreach for a long time now. It once was known for its closed approach to global politics where it did not even maintain diplomatic relations with the permanent five countries of the UN Security Council. Its stand was informed by a need to stay clear from power politics as Bhutan remained introverted and closed to the world around it. But all that had started to change in the recent years. Since the beginning of the current century, Bhutan has been focussing on forging new diplomatic connections. By 2013, it had managed to establish a diplomatic relationship with as many as 53 countries. Among all the new foreign relations that Bhutan is sealing, its equation with China is agonising India a lot.\\n\\nEarly this week, Bhutan’s foreign minister Tandi Dorji visited Beijing. There he met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi as well as Vice President of China Han Zheng. The visit was focussed on boundary talks between the two countries and also saw the signing of an agreement over the functioning of a Joint Technical Team for the same. Both countries also agreed to expedite the boundary demarcation process as well as establish formal diplomatic ties with each other. The settlement of the boundary issue between Bhutan and China will leave India as the only country out of China’s 12 neighbours with which Beijing has still not settled the boundary dispute. The possible establishment of diplomatic relations between Bhutan and China is also a worrying signal for India but it is the boundary dispute settlement that will have the most far-reaching implications for Indian security.\\n\\nThe boundary dispute between Bhutan and China goes back to the 1950s when China annexed Tibet and both countries became immediate neighbours. Unlike the relationship between autonomous Tibet and Bhutan where the border was not demarcated, China never agreed to the boundary that it inherited after its annexation of Tibet. It in fact seized control of eight Bhutanese conclaves in Tibet during its military campaign in 1959. Due to China’s belligerence and its tendency to acquire territory by force, Bhutan severed its ties with China-controlled Tibet and maintained a very sharp distance from Beijing diplomatically. Mao Zedong’s foreign policy strategy of considering Bhutan along with Nepal as one of the five fingers of Tibet, China’s right-hand palm was like a nightmare for the Bhutanese. Since then, China has conducted multiple incursions into Bhutan’s territories including in 1967, 1979, 1983 and 2017. China claims around 764 sq km of Bhutanese territory in the northern and western areas. This includes Jakarlung and Pasamlung areas in north Bhutan and the Doklam plateau in Western Bhutan.\\n\\nChina’s pressurising tactics of using military force and publishing maps with outrageous claims had been able to bring Bhutan to the negotiating table in the past. The two countries started negotiating the border dispute on an annual basis in 1984. They also signed an agreement to maintain peace at the border in 1998. Since 1984, they have held 24 rounds of boundary talks and the one that was held earlier this week marks the 25th round of boundary talks between them.\\n\\nNow the question is that if boundary talks are progressing at a fast pace between China and Bhutan then why does it worry India so much? Well, the entire bone of contention is the Doklam plateau. Doklam area is a trijunction point between India, China and Bhutan. It is a part of the Bhutanese territory but China claims it as an extension of its Chumbi Valley. China has made multiple claims on the area and in 2017, it even started construction of a road in the mountainous region. It was attempting to create infrastructure in the region in order to usurp the territory during border settlement at a later date. In fact, satellite imagery has proven how China created high-tech villages in the area. India’s worries regarding China acquiring control of Doklam stems from the fact that this plateau overlooks the strategic Siliguri corridor also known as the Chicken’s Neck which not only connects mainland India to its own northeastern states but also serves as an important international gateway by linking India with countries such as Myanmar and even Tibet. It was for this reason that India immediately pressed its military into action in 2017 in order to retaliate against China’s act of constructing a road in the area. The resultant stand-off had lasted for more than 70 days with India being successful in thwarting China from constructing the road.\\n\\nThis time, however, India’s tensions are even more profound. China’s pressurising tactics have left little choice for Bhutan. In 2020, China sprung a surprise when it made an entirely new claim out of the blue over the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary situated in Eastern Bhutan. It was an attempt by China to put more pressure on Bhutan to admit the claims that China is making under the usual boundary dispute. India’s key worry is that China may push Bhutan so much to the edge that it will be forced to accept a swap deal where China will relinquish its claims in the north in exchange for control over the Doklam plateau. A precedent for this actually exists because in 1998, China had made a similar offer to Bhutan which it had not accepted at that time. It is interesting to note that Beijing is keen to settle the boundary dispute with Bhutan but it has not shown a similar zeal towards settling its boundary dispute with India. This shows that the entire plan of China is to keep India on tenterhooks. Firstly, Beijing doesn’t want to deliberately delay settling of boundary dispute with India because a settled boundary will provide India with much relief and free up its energy to focus on its rise.\\n\\nIn contrast, an unsettled boundary will keep a check on India’s power. Secondly, any settlement of the boundary issue with Bhutan which involves China getting control over Doklam will be the best blessing for Beijing against India in this century. It will end up making India severely vulnerable by threatening its access to its own northeast in the situation of a military conflict. It is in this context that any development in Bhutan-China relations must be observed. Although India consistently points towards a 2012 understanding reached between China and India that the Bhutan-China boundary dispute will not include discussions over Doklam. Provided China’s record of honouring agreements that it has signed up for in the past, India has all the reasons to be concerned about the direction which Bhutan-China boundary negotiation will take.\\n\\nThe author is a PhD from the Department of International Relations, South Asian University.

The 80-year-old US president said Washington would respond should Tehran escalate the conflict in the Middle East.\\n\\nBiden made these remarks during a Washington joint press conference with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Wednesday as they shared their stand on Israel, Ukraine, and China during a state visit. “We have had troops in the region since 9/11 to go after ISIS and prevent its reemergence in the region — having nothing to do with Israel at all. My warning to the Ayatollah was that if they continue to move against those troops, we will respond, and he should be prepared. It has nothing to do with Israel. ,” he said, according to a transcript released by the White House.\\n\\nPresident Biden met with Prime Minister Albanese in the Oval Office to strengthen the U.S.-Australia alliance and discuss key priorities – including advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific, supporting Ukraine, and standing with Israel in the wake of Hamas’ terrorist attack. pic.twitter.com/0BtRkN6yIh— The White House (@WhiteHouse) October 25, 2023\\n\\nAlbanese’s visit underscored the importance Washington places on longtime ally Australia as a cornerstone of its strategy against an increasingly assertive Beijing in the Asia-Pacific region. “A great deal of the history of our world will be written in the Indo-Pacific in the coming years,” Biden said, using the allies’ term for the region. “Australia and the United States must write that story together.”\\n\\nDuring a day of pomp and ceremony at the White House, Biden said the alliance between Australia and the United States is an anchor to peace and prosperity. At a joint press conference with Biden, Albanese said the bond between the two countries was crucial in an “uncertain world.” “The relationship between Australia and the United States has never been more important. And it has never been stronger than it is right now,” he said.\\n\\nThough the US-Australia alliance focuses much of its might on the Indo-Pacific, the majority of Biden’s press conference on Wednesday was centered around the Middle East. Biden said both nations were “standing with Israel against Hamas terrorism”.\\n\\nFollowing the October 7 Hamas attack and subsequent Israeli response in Gaza, Biden has repeatedly warned Iranian proxy groups such as Hezbollah, which the U.S. government considers a terrorist organization, not to use the current war as cover to launch attacks.',\n",

The media outlets confirmed that the posts circulating on platforms such as Facebook and Telegram were fake.\\n\\nWhen Zelensky visited the United States last month, a doctored online video appeared to show a New York city billboard with the words “glory to urine” alongside an image of the Ukrainian leader.\\n\\nThe manipulated clip was watermarked with the logo for Fox News Digital, but a network spokesperson told AFP that it had not posted any such footage.\\n\\nIt remains unclear precisely who is behind the false claims but they fit a broader pattern of anti-Ukraine disinformation by Russia, which for decades has engaged in information warfare focused on fueling anti-Western sentiments, researchers say.\\n\\n“There has been a visible growth of Russian propaganda in Europe” compared to the first few months of 2022, Ruslan Trad, a resident fellow for security research at the DFRLab, told AFP.\\n\\n“The Kremlin is capitalizing on war fatigue and apathy, as well as the Euroskepticism and fears of Western and Central European societies.”\\n\\nRaising concerns about cracks in Western support for Kyiv, Slovakia’s new populist Prime Minister Robert Fico on Thursday said he had “informed” the European Union’s executive of his decision to stop military aid to Ukraine.\\n\\nSoon after last month’s general election — which Fico won on pledges to end assistance to Ukraine — Slovakia accused Moscow of interfering in the vote by deliberately disseminating falsehoods.\\n\\nEven in the United States — Kyiv’s biggest donor of security aid — there are concerns that opposition from hard-line Republican lawmakers has put future assistance for Kyiv in doubt.\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden is currently pushing Congress to approve a massive $106 billion security bill, which includes $61 billion in military aid for Ukraine.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Washington announced a new $150 million military assistance package for Ukraine that includes artillery and small-arms ammunition as well as anti-tank weapons.\\n\\nZelensky thanked the US for the assistance, saying “strengthening air defense is critical to protect Ukrainian cities and infrastructure” as winter approaches.\\n\\nUkraine is bracing itself for a renewed Russian bombing campaign on its energy infrastructure, which last year plunged millions of civilians into extreme hardship.\\n\\nThe European Union has also vowed steadfast support. Earlier this month, the European Parliament endorsed a proposal to provide an extra 50 billion euros ($53 billion) for Ukraine’s recovery.\\n\\nBut despite these robust pledges, US officials cited by local media have warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin seeks to end American and European support for Ukraine by using his spy agencies to push propaganda and conspiracy theories.\\n\\n“Russia is benefiting right now (from) decades of information activities,” said Adam Lelonek, from the International Republican Institute’s Beacon Project.\\n\\n“Russia cannot win this conventional war but still aspires to win in the information dimension.”\\n\\n\",\n",

Most are about 2 m in width and height.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAccording to John Spencer of the US Military Academy West Point, the sheer scale of the tunnel system underneath Gaza poses a “wicked problem” for which “no perfect solution exists”, and overcoming which, “will require a lot of time.”\\n\\nWe look at when and why these tunnels came into existence, what they are used for, and why they pose such a challenge to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\\n\\nA lifeline for a besieged people\\n\\nThe earliest tunnels underneath Gaza were probably dug as far back as the 1980s. But their scale and sophistication went up after Israel tightened its blockade of Gaza in 2007.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFor besieged Gazans, tunnels are a lifeline which provides them all kinds of essential items, from food and medicine, to hygiene products and electronics. Many lie on Gaza’s border with Egypt, from where goods are smuggled into the enclave through the city of Rafah in the Sinai peninsula.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPrior to 2013, when Egypt cracked down on cross-border smuggling, the 12 km long Egypt-Gaza border had as many as 2,500 tunnels and moved as much as 500 tons of steel and 3,000 tons of cement daily.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFor Hamas, which has poured millions of dollars into the construction and upkeep of these tunnels, they are of “existential” importance for Gazans — keeping the enclave’s battered economy afloat.\\n\\n‘A great equaliser’\\n\\nThese tunnels are also of existential importance to Hamas, smuggling weaponry and military equipment into Gaza as well. Moreover, beyond tunnels used for smuggling in the southern border, Hamas has also built ones explicitly for military purposes.\\n\\nMust Read | A to Z of the Israel-Palestine conflict\\n\\nUnderneath Gaza, there are series of ‘defensive tunnels’, used as military command centres and for weapons storage. According to western military experts, these are the tunnels through which Hamas orchestrates its military operations against Israel, as well as where it is likely hiding hostages.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAttached to these, are ‘offensive tunnels’ on the border with Israel, used for cross-border attacks and other operations. It was these tunnels that were Israel’s casus belli during the 2014 escalation.\\n\\n“The tunnels allow fighters to move between a series of fighting positions safely and freely,” Spencer, an expert in urban warfare, explained. “In short, the tunnels are a great equaliser, neutralising Israel’s advantages in weaponry, tactics, technology and organisation.”\\n\\nTackling the tunnels\\n\\nGiven how important tunnels are for Hamas, they will be a top priority for the IDF during a ground invasion. But eliminating them altogether will not be easy.\\n\\nFirst and foremost is the problem of locating these tunnels, which experts say is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Even with the availability of modern surveillance technology including radar, thermal imaging, and magnetic signatures, most tunnels are found by human detective work. This is why it is impossible to accurately say just how big the tunnel system underneath Gaza is.\\n\\nAn Israeli soldier during a media tour organised by the army of a tunnel said to be used by Palestinians for cross-border attacks, on the Israel-Gaza border, July 25, 2014. (Jack Guez/Pool via The New York Times/File Photo) An Israeli soldier during a media tour organised by the army of a tunnel said to be used by Palestinians for cross-border attacks, on the Israel-Gaza border, July 25, 2014. (Jack Guez/Pool via The New York Times/File Photo)\\n\\nSecond, even upon establishing their location, eliminating them is not a simple task. Sending in soldiers is fraught with risk as tunnels can easily be booby trapped. Fighting inside tunnels will also most certainly favour Hamas militants, with detailed knowledge of the terrain.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBunker-buster bombs, which can penetrate deep underground before exploding, risk extensive collateral damage, given how densely Gaza is populated. Although chemical agents have been used in the past, notably by the US in Vietnam, these would be regarded as “illegal” in the eyes of International Humanitarian Law.\\n\\nThe IDF is highly trained for tunnel warfare, more than any other military force in the world according to Spencer. But the “depth and scale” of Gazan tunnels will take a long time to neutralise, and come at unthinkable human cost.\\n\\nMoreover, as Daphne Richemond-Barak, author of Underground Warfare (2017), noted in an article in Financial Times, even with Israel’ concerted efforts “it is unlikely that the entirety of Gaza’s tunnel network would be destroyed.”',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'O N OCTOBER 24th António Guterres (pictured), secretary-general of the UN , called for an end to the “epic suffering” caused by Israel’s blockade and bombing of the Gaza strip. Hundreds of people had died in the preceding 24 hours, and on Tuesday only eight aid lorries had entered the territory. Such conditions, Mr Guterres said, amounted to “collective punishment of the Palestinian people” for the bloody attack on Israel carried out on October 7th by Hamas, the militant group that runs Gaza. He claimed there had been “clear violations” of international law in recent days: by Hamas, which is using civilians as human shields and holding more than 200 hostages; and by Israel, when it ordered the evacuation of northern Gaza but continued to bomb the south. Israel condemned Mr Guterres’s comments and said he should resign. But he is not alone in calling for a measured response. On October 22nd, a joint statement from the leaders of six countries, including America, urged Israel to adhere to “international humanitarian law” (without accusing the country of having broken it). What limits does the law of armed conflict impose on belligerents?\\n\\nThe principles that underlie the rules of warmaking go back centuries, often to religious texts. Deuteronomy 20:10, for example, instructs warriors to “offer peace to the people” before attacking. In 1625 Hugo Grotius, a Dutch philosopher, gave such rules a secular foundation. In “On the Law of War and Peace” he lamented a “lack of restraint in relation to war” and posited a “common law among nations” that would impose limits. Three centuries later world leaders settled on such a law in the guise of the Geneva Conventions of 1949. All of the world’s countries have signed on to these principles, which protect wounded and sick combatants, prisoners of war, and civilians during wartime. (Some countries have agreed with reservations, including the rejection of international courts’ jurisdiction over their actions.) The law of war also encompasses customary rules—general practices accepted as law despite not being formally agreed upon—and more recent treaties prohibiting the use of biological and chemical weapons, among other grisly munitions.\\n\\nViolations of the law of war are difficult to prosecute; many go unpunished. But armies that strive to adhere to the law of armed conflict follow four basic principles. The most sweeping, humanity, has its origins in the so-called Martens clause—a provision in the Hague Convention of 1899, a precursor to the Geneva Conventions, that gives individuals protection under the “dictates of public conscience” in situations when no specific treaty governs. The second is military necessity, which permits only the degree of conflict that is required to achieve a valid military objective, such as the submission of the enemy and not, say, destruction of the natural environment or historic sites. The third, distinction, requires armed forces to clearly “distinguish themselves from the civilian population while they are engaged in an attack” so as to prevent the inadvertent targeting of non-combatants. And finally, proportionality mandates that the pursuit of valid military goals cannot cause undue civilian suffering. If the collateral damage to civilians’ lives or homes is “excessive” when set against the “direct military advantage anticipated”, proportionality requires combatants to limit—or hold—their fire.\\n\\nHumanity is a worthy starting point for the law of war but, because the principle is hazy, it can be hard to tell when combatants fail to uphold it. Other standards can be applied more clearly. Pursuing armed conflict to wipe out a population or despoil their land is plainly out of bounds. Soldiers who fail to wear proper uniforms violate the principle of distinction: Hamas fighters, some of whom allegedly wore Israeli military uniforms during their attack on the country, broke this rule. Military assaults that take no account of civilian casualties or deliberately target them also break international law. But proportionality, the principle guiding the latter example, is often misunderstood. It does not hinge on absolute casualty counts but on how harm to civilian lives and infrastructure is weighed against expected military gains. That means, theoretically, that rather a lot of suffering could be permissible. In 2013 Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch claimed that American drone strikes in countries including Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan, in which many civilians died, may have been disproportionate—a claim that Barack Obama, then America’s president, denied, saying that in each case the potential loss of civilian life had been carefully weighed.\\n\\nThere is no question that Hamas’s attacks on Israelis violated the law of war, and Mr Guterres is right that in using civilians as unwilling human shields it is committing a further breach of the Geneva Conventions. Israel, for its part, is allowed to instruct Palestinians to move away from the northern half of Gaza for their own protection, but this displacement must be temporary and adequate humanitarian relief must be provided. And under any interpretation of the law of war, Israel’s proportionality calculus must take account of the many civilian casualties its air strikes and pending ground invasion will cause. But legal opinion is split on how to undertake this accounting. Israel has in the past interpreted the rules to exclude damage to apartment buildings if terrorists occupy them. And although the International Committee of the Red Cross contends that human shields must be protected unless they are physically blocking a military objective, Israel and America believe that civilians who voluntarily serve as human shields are participants, not bystanders. Telling the difference is hard at the best of times—and the fog of war makes clarity harder still. ■',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Islamist militia linked to Iran have continued to strike US bases in Syria and Iraq, intensifying a campaign of violence that will raise fears of a regional conflagration.\\n\\nThe attacks have been claimed by groups either directly controlled by Tehran or sharing the ideology of other groups currently fighting Israel. On Thursday, a US base at Kharab al-Jir in Syria was attacked for the second time in two days, and a base in western Iraq was also hit.\\n\\nMore than a dozen small-scale strikes on US bases in the region have wounded 24 US soldiers and caused the death of one civilian contractor. Washington is rushing anti-missile batteries to the region to protect its principal bases and allies.\\n\\nCharles Lister, the director of the Syria and countering terrorism and extremism programmes at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said: “The US has now had two dozen soldiers injured. In any other conditions it would have responded but its hands are tied because it does not want to be blamed for escalating. The US government is very concerned that we are walking into a regional crisis.\\n\\n“The attacks show that Iran has an extensive network of well-armed, aggressive and well-coordinated proxies across the region which it has established for exactly this scenario. They are currently testing redlines but not pushing too hard. They are putting the onus on the US to respond.”\\n\\nJoe Biden has already ordered two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean and US officials are reported to have asked Israel to hold off on a ground invasion of Gaza until new anti-missile units have reached their destinations.\\n\\nThe war between Israel and Hamas has followed the terrorist attacks launched by Hamas into southern Israel, which killed 1,400 people, mainly civilians. So far Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed 7,000, according to Hamas-run health authorities in the enclave.\\n\\nEven without a ground offensive by Israeli troops into Gaza, the rising death toll there is likely to bring further escalation.\\n\\nOne Iraq-based and Iran-supported group, believed to be a front for the long-established Kateb Hezbollah, last week issued a statement threatening attacks on US military bases in the UAE and Kuwait. Paramilitaries from militia in Syria that are controlled by Iran have been deployed close to the Golan Heights, in a further threatening move.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, leading officials of the three principal Islamist extremist groups currently at war with Israel met in Beirut to discuss the conflict.\\n\\nAfter the meeting in Lebanon, a brief statement said Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, had agreed with Hamas’s Saleh al-Arouri and Palestine Islamic Jihad’s leader, Ziad al-Nakhleh, that the three – along with other Iran-backed militants – wanted to achieve “a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestine” and halt Israel’s “treacherous and brutal aggression against our oppressed and steadfast people in Gaza and the West Bank”.\\n\\nTobias Borck, a senior research fellow in Middle East security studies at London’s Royal United Services Institute, said Iran was “literally playing with fire”.\\n\\n“What we are seeing is the next level out from the Gazan war. This is all carefully calibrated to show solidarity. Iran is saying: we see the aircraft carriers but we are not scared and we can hurt you too. It is incredibly dangerous,” Borck told the Guardian.\\n\\n“A lot of people want to understand it as Tehran pulling the strings but … actually these are partners who share a worldview and ideology. One element is claiming the mantle of leading the opposition to a western-imposed order in the region.”\\n\\nThe impression of a growing regional conflict was reinforced by Israeli airstrikes against Syrian army infrastructure in response to rockets launched from Syria, an ally of Iran, last week. Syria’s state news agency said the attack near the south-western city of Daraa killed eight soldiers.\\n\\nThe strike followed the launch of two rockets that set off air raid sirens in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.\\n\\nIsraeli warplanes also bombed an airport in Aleppo, in northern Syria, in a move that experts said was probably intended to disrupt supplies of ammunition and arms from Iran to Hezbollah in Syria.\\n\\nHezbollah has been exchanging fire with Israeli troops along the border between Lebanon and Israel since the day after the 7 October attacks.\\n\\nBoth sides appear to have been trying to avoid escalation. An estimated 40 Hezbollah fighters have been killed in the clashes so far, while the Israeli military has also announced some deaths among its ranks.\\n\\nIsraeli officials have said they would retaliate aggressively in the case of a cross-border attack by Hezbollah from Lebanon, but fear the organisation’s arsenal of about 150,000 rockets and missiles.\\n\\nBoth sides are trying to pre-empt any blame for further and greater hostilities.\\n\\nThe White House said on Monday that the US had detected “an uptick in rocket and drone attacks by Iranian-backed proxy groups against military bases housing US personnel in Iraq and Syria” and was “deeply concerned about the potential for any significant escalation of these attacks in the days ahead”.\\n\\nLast week a US warship in the northern Red Sea intercepted missiles fired by Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen, possibly at Israel.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Vivek Katju\\n\\nFormer Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs\\n\\nINDIA’S response to the Hamas terror attack starkly shows the changing nature of its diplomatic practice and articulation. These transformations are driven partly by the pressures exerted by the media, both mainstream and social, which have diminished response times of the political leadership as well as diplomats to evolving regional or global crises. At the same time, the predilection of the top leadership to take to social media, even as events are unfolding, is also a major factor.\\n\\nLeaders’ social media comments on global issues should be so crafted that they do not raise doubts about basic policy positions.\\n\\nThe problem is that while sometimes these social media comments are innocuous, on other occasions they give rise to confusion, especially in the case of complex issues with long histories. It is, therefore, essential that those who manage the social media accounts of the top leadership are aware of the complexities of foreign policymaking and the need for nuanced diplomatic comments.\\n\\nThe October 7 Hamas attack threw Israel’s intelligence and military establishment into complete confusion for many hours. The New York Times, which has always had deep access in the Israeli governmental system, noted in a report: “The speed, precision and scale of the Hamas attack had thrown the Israeli military into disarray...” The report stated that Hamas fighters overwhelmed eight Israeli military bases. They also neutralised an intelligence centre near Gaza, thereby compromising the army’s ‘communications and surveillance’ systems. The terror attack killed 1,300 Israelis, including 286 military personnel. This number included those who fought the Hamas fighters. Around 150 Israelis and people of other nationalities were abducted and taken to Gaza by Hamas.\\n\\nWith communications down amid the confusion caused by an unprecedented attack, the Israeli authorities would have come to know the details of the destruction caused by Hamas only by the evening of October 7. If this was the situation within Israel, the outside world naturally had an incomplete picture of what was happening. Therefore, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted on the Hamas attack at 4.44 pm on October 7, he and his advisers would have mainly gone by media reports and such information that the Indian embassy in Tel Aviv and India’s contacts in Israel and elsewhere could have provided. Despite the limited information that would have been available to him, the PM decided to tweet. He expressed shock at the attack and stressed: “We stand in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour.”\\n\\nThis expression of solidarity was correct because of Hamas’ savagery. While the tweet was fine as an expression against terrorism, the problem was that its narrow focus and brevity made it difficult for the diplomatic community and analysts to comprehend if it signalled a modified Indian approach to India’s position on the larger Israel-Palestine issue. This was particularly so because unlike some Western countries, India has not designated Hamas as a terrorist organisation.\\n\\nThis incomprehension about Indian policy continued because after the tweet, India made no comment on the situation, which was becoming increasingly clear from the morning of October 8, for the next three days. On October 10, Modi again tweeted after receiving a phone call from Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu. Modi emphasised: “People of India stand firmly with Israel at this difficult hour. India strongly and unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.” This tweet, too, did not really go beyond Modi’s first one. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued a brief press statement, essentially reproducing the content of the tweet. Thus, the confusion on India’s stand on the Israel-Palestine issue was not removed by the tweet or the statement.\\n\\nIf anything, the confusion increased because by October 10, Israel’s response to the Hamas attack had led to hundreds of civilian deaths in Gaza. Besides, the Indian statement, unlike those of many Arab and other countries, did not caution against an Israeli response that would cause a humanitarian disaster in Gaza. As India’s focus was only on Hamas’ terrorism, questions on India’s broader policy on the Israel-Palestine relations became more urgent after October 10, but there were no answers from Indian officials.\\n\\nThe fact is that once the Prime Minister tweets, it becomes very difficult for diplomats or even ministers to clarify broader policy positions to avoid a dilution of the PM’s message or intention. In the ‘old’ Indian diplomatic tradition, statements were made by the MEA. That left space for modifications, clarifications and even reversals without the political leadership, let alone the PM, getting publicly involved. All this ensured that any confusion could be addressed at the diplomatic level and it left the PM to make carefully crafted statements which took all aspects of a situation and Indian interests into account.\\n\\nThe broader questions were finally cleared at the media briefing given by the MEA spokesperson on October 12. He correctly reiterated that the October 7 incident was a terror attack and condemned it, but did not take a position on the designation of Hamas as a terrorist organisation. He said that issue was for the ‘relevant’ authorities. On the Palestine issue, the spokesperson said: “Our policy in this regard is long-standing and consistent. India has always advocated the resumption of direct negotiations towards establishing a sovereign, independent state of Palestine, living within secure and recognised borders, side by side at peace with Israel. I think that position remains the same.” Significantly, he also said: “There is a (sic) universal obligation, I think, to observe international humanitarian law.”\\n\\nIt is doubtful if Israel would have been happy with these clarifications. Naturally, they would have been cleared at the highest levels of the government. India has to condemn terrorism and Israel has helped it at critical times. There is, therefore, no doubt that the Israeli relationship is important, but India has very significant interests in West Asia and they cannot be ignored.\\n\\nIf leaders cannot avoid social media comments on global issues, they should be so crafted that they do not raise doubts about basic policy positions even while stressing, as in this case, India’s strong position on terrorism.\\n\\n#Hamas #Social Media',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'In a heart-wrenching moment on Wednesday, an Al Jazeera anchor struggled to hold back tears as he reported a tragic incident involving a colleague. The family of a fellow Al Jazeera journalist fell victim to an Israeli air strike in Gaza.\\n\\nThe anchor, broadcasting on the Qatar-based network, bravely delivered the heartbreaking news. The family of Al Jazeera’s Gaza correspondent, Wael Al-Dahdouh, was caught in the crossfire and tragically lost their lives. His wife and two children were among the casualties of an air strike that hit the Nuseirat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.\\n\\nThe anchor struggled to make the announcement while fighting back emotions. He conveyed the tragic incident, saying, “We note this breaking news that we transmit on the Al Jazeera network. A number of family members of our colleague, Wael Al Dahdouh were killed, including his wife, son, and daughter.” Al-Dahdouh was in the field, reporting on the very bombing that took the lives of his family members.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe journalist’s family had sought refuge in a temporary residence after evacuating Gaza City. This move came after Israel’s warnings to residents to relocate to the southern areas as the Israeli military intensified its strikes, particularly targeting Hamas strongholds. The anchor pointed out the tragic irony, saying, “This is the safe zone the occupation (Israeli) army was talking about.”\\n\\nWael Hamdan Ibrahim Al-Dahdouh, a prominent Palestinian journalist, held the position of bureau chief for Al Jazeera in Gaza City. His career in journalism began in 1998 when he worked as a correspondent for the Palestinian newspaper Al-Quds in Gaza. He later contributed to various Palestinian magazines. In the early 2000s, he served as a correspondent for the Voice of Palestine radio and the Sahar satellite channel during the Second Intifada in 2000.\\n\\nIn 2003, he expanded his career by becoming a correspondent for Al Arabiya. However, his most significant role was yet to come. In 2004, he transitioned to working as a reporter and held an official position in the Al-Jazeera office in the Gaza Strip.\\n\\nThe loss of Al-Dahdouh’s family is a stark reminder of the human toll that conflicts like the one in Gaza can exact. It underscores the personal sacrifices that journalists and their families often make in their pursuit of truth and information. Our hearts go out to Al-Dahdouh and his family, as well as to all those affected by the ongoing situation in Gaza.',\n",

It is an attempt to tie Israel\\'s hands, preventing us from eliminating a huge threat to our citizens.\"\\n\\nBut the calls for a cease-fire, the protection of Palestinian civilians facing constant Israeli bombardments in Gaza and the delivery of desperately needed food, water, medicine and fuel were often passionate and intense from nearly a dozen countries that spoke Thursday.\\n\\nWhile the Hamas attacks killed some 1,400 Israelis, more than 7,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel\\'s retaliatory airstrikes, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\\n\\nOn another key issue - the more than 220 hostages taken from Israel - Iran\\'s foreign minister said Hamas is ready to release civilian prisoners to the Islamic Republic, and he said the international community must take responsibility for releasing 6,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.\\n\\nIran \"stands ready to play its part in this very important humanitarian endeavor, along with Qatar and Turkey,\" Hossein Amirabdollahian told the assembly.\\n\\nIran is a key backer of Hamas and Qatar has already played a key role in the release of four Israeli civilians.\\n\\nIsrael\\'s Erdan said the country\\'s action has nothing to do with the Arab-Israeli conflict or the Palestinian question. \"This is not a war with the Palestinians.\\n\\nIsrael is at war with the genocidal Jihadist Hamas terror organization,\" he said.\\n\\nBut Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, said 70% of those killed in Gaza were children and women. \"Is this the war some of you are defending? Can this war be defended? These are crimes. This is barbarism,\" he said.\\n\\n\"If you do not stop it for all those who were killed, stop it for all those whose lives we can still save,\" he said.\\n\\nThe anguish over the deaths on both sides was palpable.\\n\\nMansour\\'s voice cracked when he spoke of a Palestinian girl killed before the birthday her father had planned and a man hugging the body of his dead mother and saying: \"Come back, and I will take you wherever you want.\"\\n\\nErdan\\'s voice rose when he told the assembly of Hamas fighters firing blindly at hundreds of young people at a concert in southern Israel, parading naked girls that they had raped, and crushing the skulls of babies.\\n\\nHe showed a brief video of a badly injured agricultural worker from Thailand being decapitated \"with a blunt gardening tool.\"\\n\\nJordan\\'s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, speaking on behalf of the 22-nation Arab Group, spoke emotionally of children dying under the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli precision bombs, and some still alive and trapped with no equipment to pull them out. \"The parents can still hear them.\\n\\nThey talk to them helplessly, knowing that they are running out of air and are slowly dying,\" he said.\\n\\nIn a sharp rebuke to the Israeli ambassador, he told the assembly, \"I don\\'t have videos to show you. We respect the dead too much. We respect the pain of their families too much to show videos.\"\\n\\nSafadi also criticized Erdan for not saying a word \"about Palestinian lives shattered in this war.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t let them tell you this is a war between Muslims and Jews,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We value life, Muslim life, Christian life, Jewish life.\" He was interrupted with applause when he then said, \"We care about all lives. ... Don\\'t let them tell you otherwise.\"\\n\\nThe Jordanian minister also told Israel that it cannot remain above international law requiring protection of civilians, hospitals, schools, homes and other infrastructure.\\n\\n\"The right to self-defense is not a license to kill with impunity,\" he stressed.\\n\\nSafadi also criticized the United States and its allies without naming them.\\n\\n\"Many among us believe that they are helping Israel by supporting its war,\" he said. \"They are not. Instead of sending weapons to Israel, send delegations to open an immediate and viable path to peace. This is how they can help Israel.\"\\n\\nIran\\'s Amirabdollahian accused the United States of directly participating in the war and what he called a \"genocide\" against the Palestinians.\\n\\n\"The genocide in Gaza must stop immediately,\" he said.\\n\\nHe warned against \"the uncontrollable consequences of the unlimited financial, arms and operational support by the White House to the Tel Aviv regime\" which has added to the severe bombardments and killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.\\n\\nThe emergency General Assembly meeting resumes Friday morning, with about 100 speakers remaining.\\n\\nThe resolution that Mansour said will be put to a vote on Friday afternoon calls for an immediate cease-fire and demands that all parties respect international law and protect civilians.\\n\\nIt says that essential goods including food, water and medicine should be provided in the Gaza Strip. It also calls for Israel to rescind its order for Gazans to move from the north to the south, for maximum restraint and for the release of all civilians.\\n\\nUnlike the Security Council, there are no vetoes in the General Assembly and its resolutions are not legally binding. But they do reflect world opinion and the size of the vote in favor will be closely watched.\\n\\nThe Palestinians have wide support, but Israel\\'s Erdan called the resolution \"a disgrace\" for not even mentioning Hamas and urged countries to oppose it.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'October 22, 2023\\n\\nTurkey has been trying to carefully calibrate its stance in the face of the war that Hamas launched against Israel on Oct. 7, maintaining its advocacy of the Palestinian cause while cooling ties with Hamas and seeking to avoid a fresh fallout with Israel.\\n\\nThe crisis hit at a time when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is pursuing normalization with regional powers including Israel. After years of bilateral spats, Erdogan met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York last month and invited him to visit Ankara.\\n\\nAt first glance, one could suggest that the Erdogan government’s close relations with Hamas have now driven it into a corner. Moreover, one could expect growing US pressure on Ankara to sever ties with Hamas after the dust settles.\\n\\nNevertheless, for the West, Turkey at present represents a partner who can talk to Hamas, and this serves as a sort of lightning rod for Erdogan’s government. The calls made to Ankara requesting its mediation for the release of foreign hostages held by Hamas have given Erdogan the opportunity to play the role he was hoping for.\\n\\nUnlike his vitriolic outbursts against Israel in the past, Erdogan has restrained his language this time, careful not to jeopardize the new chapter that he had just opened with Israel. He may have toughened his tone against Israel a bit over the mounting casualties in Gaza, but he has withheld the support that would please Hamas.\\n\\n\\'Dissatisfaction with Turkey\\'\\n\\nAcknowledging the disappointment on the Palestinian side, a Palestinian source in Ankara told Al-Monitor, “The Palestinian groups, including Hamas, have been dissatisfied with Turkey’s stance. Its statements are viewed as inadequate. They did not even summon the Israeli ambassador to the Foreign Ministry.”\\n\\nHamas\\' political head Ismail Haniyeh, who lives in voluntary exile in Qatar and Turkey, was in Istanbul when Hamas breached the Israeli walls. Haniyeh was politely sent away after footage circulated on social media showing him and other Hamas members prostrating themselves in a “prayer of gratitude” while watching news of the incursion on television, two different sources told Al-Monitor. Ankara was annoyed also by remarks that Saleh al-Arouri, Haniyeh’s deputy, made to Al Jazeera that day. Arouri bragged that Hamas had captured enough Israeli soldiers to force Israel to free all Palestinian prisoners in its jails and would continue to fight. According to the two sources, Ankara politely asked Haniyeh and his entourage to leave Turkey, unwilling to appear to be protecting Hamas after the group’s killing of Israeli civilians.\\n\\nOn Monday, a Turkish official denied claims that the government had ordered Haniyeh and the other senior officials to leave Turkey.\\n\\nIn an interview with Turkey’s Haberturk TV last week, Khaled Meshaal, another senior Hamas figure, implied that the group expected stronger support from Ankara. “I have great respect for Turkey. Turkey should say ‘stop’ to … Israel,” he said.\\n\\nStill, Ankara may not be seeing the current cooling of ties as irreversible, and Hamas leaders may not make an issue of it in the hope that Turkey’s door remains open to them.\\n\\nHowever, Ankara is unlikely to toughen its stance on Hamas as much as its Western partners would like. Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan seemed to preclude a drastic shift in Ankara’s position when he underlined Tuesday that the perspectives of the West and Turkey differ. \"Since the Westerners define Hamas as a terrorist organization, they appraise all its activities in the framework of terrorism. We, for our part, say that no party should target civilians,” he said.\\n\\nAt the behest of Erdogan, Turkish intelligence and Foreign Ministry officials have held contacts with Hamas but have allegedly failed to get a positive response to mediation offers. Some seem to take this as a sign that Ankara lacks influence, but in the initial stage of the conflict, Hamas has not been open to proposals from Qatar and Egypt either.\\n\\nAccording to the Palestinian source, the pressure on Ankara to cut ties with Hamas is coming mostly from the United States rather than Israel.\\n\\nAs for the mediation efforts, the source said that Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other resistance groups in Gaza are unwilling to discuss any mediation at present. All proposals have called for the release of the hostages in return for halting Israeli air raids, the resumption of water and power supplies to Gaza, and the opening of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt — but the groups in Gaza insist that the bombings should stop before any discussions can take place, the source explained. “If the parties become ready for a cease-fire, Egypt would not leave the mediation to anyone. Qatar and Turkey could play side roles,” he added.\\n\\nA source close to the Turkish government said the contacts with Hamas had shifted mostly to Qatar, with Egypt retaining its traditional role, while Turkey was more active in contacts with Iran and Lebanon in a bid to prevent the risk of Hezbollah opening a new front in the conflict. The source acknowledged a cooling in Ankara’s ties with Hamas, even though contacts continued. Turkey’s president and foreign minister have spoken with their Iranian counterparts over the phone, and Fidan held talks in Lebanon on Tuesday.\\n\\nErdogan discussed Gaza in a phone call with the leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, on Saturday, Reuters reported. Erdogan told Haniyeh about Ankara\\'s efforts for a ceasefire, for humanitarian aid to reach Gaza and possible treatment of the wounded in Turkey.\\n\\nRestrain and caution\\n\\nAs in previous Palestinian-Israeli conflicts, Egypt, which ruled Gaza for nearly two decades after the creation of Israel in 1948 and continues to control the Rafah crossing, is seen as the actor that is the likeliest to set up a negotiating table, while Turkey’s role remains limited. Egypt has kept its distance from Hamas, being an enemy of the Muslim Brotherhood, and wields more influence over Palestinian groups in general as it is seen as a more reliable mediator by Israel.\\n\\nRegardless of what Ankara’s mediation efforts achieve, they increase Erdogan’s regional activism. Whenever Turkey has raised its diplomatic profile, as in the war against Ukraine and the grain corridor crisis, Erdogan has skillfully used that to project an image as a sought-after leader in the international arena.\\n\\nFidan’s efforts, including phone calls with numerous counterparts and visits to Cairo and Beirut, seem to focus on the release of the hostages, the prevention of a deeper humanitarian crisis and the regionalization of the conflict, and the revival of the two-state solution process. Speaking to journalists earlier this week, he said Ankara was proposing a system of guarantors in an eventual Israeli-Palestinian settlement, with Turkey among the guarantors of the Palestinian side.\\n\\nThe restraint and caution marking the Erdogan government’s new stance could be attributed to several factors.\\n\\nFirst, the usage value of the Palestinian cause in domestic politics has been decreasing. With the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, popular sentiment against Islamist groups has grown, eroding tolerance for the use of violence by Palestinian groups.\\n\\nSecond, the energy equilibrium in the Eastern Mediterranean dictates good relations with Israel.\\n\\nTurkey’s interventionist posture in Arab countries was a major factor behind the deterioration of its ties with Gulf heavyweights. Erdogan’s reconciliation drive in the past couple of years has been underlain by big economic interests, and he now feels the need to step on the brakes on the Palestinian issue.\\n\\nThird, the strategic decision to mend fences also with the United States and the European Union requires Turkey to readjust its posture in the Middle East.\\n\\nWhether it can pull it off this time remains unclear, but Ankara has learned well from the Ukraine war that it makes gains by playing the role of a mediator.\\n\\nUpdate: Oct. 23, 2023. This article has been updated since its initial publication to include a statement from a Turkish official.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Following Hamas atrocities in Israel earlier this month, the Israeli government mounted a counteroffensive in which it reportedly dropped 6,000 bombs on Gaza — an area about double the size of Washington, D.C., with triple the population — in the first several days. Many aspects of the Israeli campaign raise serious international law concerns. Regardless of Hamas’ war crimes, the Israeli government is bound to comply with the law of armed conflict. As the leading provider of weapons and military aid to Israel, the United States bears special responsibility for international law violations and harm to civilians.\\n\\nInvestigators and legal experts at leading human rights organizations claim that the Israeli government has used white phosphorus in Gaza, and one organization found that it did so in ways that violate international law. White phosphorus munitions are used as smokescreens, target markers, and incendiary weapons that burn at nearly 1500 degrees Fahrenheit when exposed to the air. Water does not extinguish white phosphorus, and severe burns on just a tenth of a person’s body are often fatal. Survivors of severe burns, respiratory damage, and organ failure are often left with injuries and chronic conditions that can last a lifetime.\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch concludes that using white phosphorus “in densely populated areas of Gaza” violates international humanitarian law, also known as the law of armed conflict. Similarly, Amnesty International researchers found “compelling evidence” of the Israeli military using white phosphorus “in densely populated civilian areas in Gaza, many of which may be considered unlawful indiscriminate attacks.” The Israeli government has denied that it used white phosphorus. Both human rights groups provide extensive information about their research standards and investigation processes.\\n\\nIn its investigation, Amnesty International said it identified U.S. Department of Defense codes on Israel’s phosphorus-based munitions. The munitions may have been exported from the United States. Israel’s military has faced claims it used American white phosphorus before. In 2009, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International claims to have identified that Israel used white phosphorus munitions made in Louisiana and Arkansas during the 2008–2009 Gaza war. After Israeli rights groups sued, the Israeli military announced plans to “significantly reduce” its usage of white phosphorus munitions in urban areas.\\n\\nAlthough white phosphorus provides a specific example of possible U.S. complicity in violations, it is far from the only measure in the war that international law experts have identified as violations or possible atrocity crimes. Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant ordered a siege on Gaza with “no electricity, no food, no fuel,” an order that experts have identified as a war crime and potential crime against humanity. According to a UN special rapporteur and leading human rights and humanitarian organizations, Israel’s order for 1.1 million people in Gaza to evacuate the northern half of the territory within 24 hours also violated international humanitarian law. In a rare public determination, the International Committee of the Red Cross called the order “not compatible with international humanitarian law.” A group of over 45 UN special rapporteurs condemned “Israel’s indiscriminate military attacks” in Gaza, noting that indiscriminately targeting civilians is a war crime.\\n\\nWhile debates among lawyers will doubtlessly continue, the human cost of the Israeli offensive is irrefutable: Gaza’s health ministry reports that Israeli strikes have killed at least 4,300 people, including 1,750 children. Families on both sides of the border mourn loved ones and fear for their safety as Hamas attacks killed over 1,400 people.\\n\\nEach year, the United States provides $3.3 billion in military aid to Israel annually, making it the top recipient of U.S. foreign military financing. The United States has already begun sending weapons to Israel for use in its offensive, with small-diameter bombs, artillery shells, ammunition, and other weapons already delivered or on the way. Explosive weapons pose an especially high risk to civilians in urban areas.\\n\\nThe State Department recently developed guidance to respond to reports of harm to civilians involving U.S. weapons. Many civilian deaths and damage to civilian infrastructure likely involve weapons from the United States, meaning that the war in Gaza may present the first major test of the guidance reported in September.\\n\\nBut despite the guidance and reports of international law violations, the United States has not placed any conditions on arms transfers to Israel. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said, “we would hope and expect that they would do the right things in the prosecution of their campaign.”\\n\\nUnconditional support could expose U.S. officials to international legal liability for aiding and abetting war crimes, a State Department concern during U.S. support for Saudi-led coalition airstrikes in Yemen. The International Criminal Court already has an open investigation that covers violations in Gaza.\\n\\nThe cornerstone U.S. law on security assistance and human rights — as currently implemented — is probably not being applied to Israeli violations in Gaza. The Leahy Law, which prohibits security assistance to units of foreign security forces credibly accused of gross violations of human rights, has historically not been implemented for the vast majority of US military assistance to Israel. And the U.S. government generally interprets the Leahy Law as inapplicable to wartime violations of the law of armed conflict.\\n\\nBased on public statements and policy implementation, the Biden administration does not appear to be conducting due diligence to ensure that U.S. military assistance and weapons do not contribute to international humanitarian law violations and atrocities.\\n\\nThe Biden administration should do all it can to protect civilians in Gaza and Israel. But in light of the Biden administration’s reluctance to push the Israeli military to protect civilian lives, Congress must step in.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, members of Congress should call for a ceasefire to save civilian lives and pressure the administration to prioritize humanitarian access. A new resolution led by Reps. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) does just that.\\n\\nRegarding U.S. weapons and other security assistance, legislators must push for President Biden to use U.S. leverage to advocate for a ceasefire and insist that the Israeli military take all feasible precautions to prevent harm to civilians. In line with the Biden administration’s arms transfer policy — which a recently resigned State Department official accused the administration of violating — the United States must not provide the Israeli government with weapons likely to be used in atrocities, based on both current practices and past violations.\\n\\nJohn Ramming Chappell (@jwrchappell) is an Advocacy & Legal Fellow at Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC).',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'The warning signs that Israel’s war with Hamas may become a wider Middle East conflagration are flashing ominously. America has sent a second carrier strike group led by the USS Eisenhower to the Persian Gulf. “There’s a likelihood of escalation,\" said Antony Blinken, the American secretary of state, on October 22nd. The chances of further attacks by Iranian proxies on American forces are growing, he continued: “We don’t want to see a second or third front develop.\"\\n\\nFears are also growing in Lebanon that Israel could use America’s cover to launch a pre-emptive strike. Israel has evacuated its towns near the border with Lebanon and Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has cautioned that if Hizbullah, an Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, enters the fighting, the consequences for Lebanon will be devastating. One reason Israel has delayed its offensive in Gaza may be to bolster its preparations for escalation on its northern front. Iran’s foreign minister has said the region is like a “powder keg\".\\n\\nIran’s autocratic rulers hold one of the matches that could set it alight: an “axis of resistance\", or network of violent proxies across the region. They have spent two decades building this up in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Iran preys on places where the local polity is weak, where it is easy to funnel in personnel and weapons and where no external actor can challenge it, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank based in London. Iran’s ability to cause mayhem at arm’s length—through Hamas, Hizbullah, Iraq’s plethora of Shia militias and Yemen’s Houthis—may even give it more leverage than its conventional military capabilities, which are relatively weak.\\n\\nIran’s goal right now, as it has been over the past decade, is not to provoke outright war with the West and its allies but to sow uncertainty and instability. Just as it has hovered on the threshold of becoming a nuclear power, so it maintains strategic ambiguity with the axis. It denies it is in charge while supplying armed groups like the Houthis with arms, giving them training and using them as fronts to conduct attacks, such as a missile strike on Saudi Aramco in 2019 which temporarily shuttered 5% of global oil production. The purpose is to intimidate while complicating the West’s calculus. That strategy pleases Iran’s ever-closer friend, Russia. Similarly isolated from the West, it engages in weapons trade and sanctions-busting with the Islamic republic: think of Iranian-designed Shahed-136 kamikaze drones killing Ukrainians.\\n\\nThe present crisis shows the opportunities and problems of Iran’s approach. It has long sponsored Hamas but did not appear to know in advance about its attack on Israel on October 7th, according to Western officials familiar with the matter. Yet it has sought to capitalise on Hamas’s atrocities and mobilise the axis of resistance. Hizbullah and Israel have exchanged fire, with the explicit support of Iran and America, respectively. As many as 19 of Hizbullah’s fighters have been killed. The Houthis, who control Yemen’s capital, have launched three medium-range cruise missiles, recently acquired from Iran, and a number of drones towards Eilat, Israel’s port city (they were intercepted by an American destroyer). And Iranian-backed Shia militias in Syria and Iraq have broadened the struggle by repeatedly targeting bases housing American troops with rockets and drones (America has drawn down its diplomatic presence in Iraq as a result).\\n\\nView Full Image (Graphic: The Economist)\\n\\nFor Iran, there are some obvious benefits. The conflagration in Gaza has halted—even if only temporarily—talks on normalising relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Any such agreement would mark a further step in the Abraham accords through which Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates have since 2020 established diplomatic ties with Israel. Iran’s Shia ayatollahs cannot stand the idea of being isolated as Sunni-led Muslim states and Israel co-operate more. A push to delegitimise the Abraham accords continues: at a meeting of Muslim foreign ministers in Saudi Arabia on October 18th, Iran called on Muslim countries to impose an oil embargo on Israel. The Iranian regime is backing calls to push Egypt to take in Palestinians from Gaza, perhaps in the hope of aggravating tensions between Israel and its oldest Arab ally.\\n\\nRegional turmoil also means more cash for Iran, at least for now. Oil prices have climbed by over $5 per barrel since October 7th. America is anxious to tamp down inflation in the run-up to its election next year and has been tacitly allowing Iran to export more oil, despite formally retaining sanctions. “Those Iranian barrels are very important\" to Joe Biden, says Ahmed Mehdi, a London-based oil analyst. Production has topped 3m barrels per day, its highest levels since the Trump administration imposed sanctions in 2018. Year on year, Mr Mehdi says, exports are up by over a third.\\n\\nYet the escalating proxy war with America and its friends comes with big risks for Iran. At home officials crow that they have become “statesmen\" again, with president Ebrahim Raisi—viewed by many in the West as a hardline pariah—speaking to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in recent days. Ordinary Iranians are less impressed. A regional war could prompt a new cycle of protests at home. Armita Geravand, an Iranian schoolgirl who collapsed on October 1st after a beating from the morality police, according to local activists, has been declared brain-dead—news that could revive the outrage that brought Iranian protesters into the streets in 2022 after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, detained for “improperly\" wearing the mandatory veil. Iranians are exhausted by their regime’s adventures abroad and reluctant to endure more suffering for Palestine. Government-organised protests have been sparsely attended. A minute’s silence at a football match in Tehran for those killed in Gaza was interrupted by raucous guffaws. “Neither Gaza nor Lebanon,\" protesters chanted from their windows. “We sacrifice our lives for Iran.\"\\n\\nIran’s shadow war is a delicate game and it is not clear that the country can control its proxies. Since America’s assassination of Qassem Suleimani, one of the masterminds behind the axis of resistance, three years ago, Iran’s satellites have increased their autonomy. As they hurl threats of war along with their rockets, they may find it hard to step back from their rhetoric. Each has set “red lines\" for intervention against Israel and the West. A failure to respond could puncture their credibility with local supporters. An Israeli ground invasion of Gaza could force their hand.\\n\\nThe proxies must also balance their military aspirations with the interests of their host countries. According to Iranian officials, Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, has told Hizbullah he has no desire to heed its calls to attack Israel from his territory. In his view, Hamas betrayed him by siding with the rebellion against him in 2011 after he gave them sanctuary. He does not want to fight for them now.\\n\\nLebanon fears being another sacrificial pawn. Its Shias are the country’s largest sect, but its other 17 official denominations form a majority. Tellingly, Hassan Nasrallah, Hizbullah’s leader famed for his belligerent speeches, has shied from addressing his public from his bunker in Beirut since the fighting began. The threat of war has kiboshed Lebanon’s hopes of a tourism revival. Lloyd’s, an insurance firm, has signalled it could withdraw cover, and Middle East Airlines, Lebanon’s national carrier, is docking some of its fleet in Turkey. America has told its citizens to leave. The Lebanese prime minister has said “the decision regarding war and peace\" is out of his hands.\\n\\nIf Iran’s proxies attack American interests, or possibly Israel, it is most likely that America retaliates against them, rather than their sponsor Iran, in the first instance. Still, that is a high-stakes gamble. And in the long run Iran’s decision to mobilise the axis of resistance signals it is heading towards isolation and autocracy. Only a month ago, the regime was celebrating a prisoner exchange with America and the imminent transfer to Iran of $6bn of frozen oil revenues. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had blessed direct talks for the first time since the Trump administration withdrew from a nuclear deal. Some spoke of a new detente. Now that lies in tatters—and the chances of a catastrophic wider war, while still low, are far too high for comfort.\\n\\n© 2023, The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.

       " {'articleBody': \"‘Total Collapse’ Of Health System In Gaza; Medical Staff Killed, Newborns Fight For Life\\n\\nIsrael Hamas Conflict has turned into a war and has entered its fourth week. Amid the attacks, it has been announced by a Palestinian spokesperson that there has been a 'total collapse' of the health system in Gaza.\\n\\nBy Ananya Srivastava\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGaza Strip Medical System Collapses Totally\\n\\nNew Delhi: Israel and Palestine have been at opposite ends of diplomatic relations for decades and the conflict between the two nations has been going on for a very long time. On October 7, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, firing thousands of rockets and sending its forces into Israeli territory, to which Israel responded with massive airstrikes and punitive measures, including a siege on the enclave with supplies of water, electricity, fuel, and other necessities being cut off. The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict has so far killed nearly 5,800 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and more than 1,400 people in Israel. As always, the war has had and continues to have devastating effects with loss of life and property; with continuous attacks, both Gaza and Israel have their complaints and issues. According to a Palestinian spokesperson, the medical system in the Gaza Strip has ‘collapsed completely’.\\n\\n‘Total Collapse’ Of Medical System In Gaza: Palestinian Spokesperson\\n\\nA Palestinian spokesman has announced the “total collapse” of the health system in the Gaza Strip due to power outage and the exhaustion of fuel needed to operate generators in hospitals. Ashraf Al-Qudra, spokesman for the Gaza-based Health Ministry, told a press conference on Tuesday that Israeli attacks had so far killed 65 medical staff, destroyed 25 ambulances, and made 12 hospitals and 32 health centres in the Palestinian enclave inoperable, Xinhua news agency reported. “We fear that more (hospitals and health centres) will be out of service in the coming hours due to the attacks and running out of fuel,” said the spokesman.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nFuel Shortage In Hospitals May Kill Newborn Babies\\n\\nIt was reported a few days ago that many newborn premature babies are at risk due to the fuel shortage in the hospitals in the Gaza Strip. “The responsibility on us is huge,” Iyad Abu Zahar, Hospital Director of Al-Aqsa Hospital said. Doctors treating premature babies across Gaza are grappling with similar fears. At least 130 premature babies are at “grave risk” across six neonatal units, aid workers said. The dangerous fuel shortages are caused by the Israeli blockade of Gaza, which started – along with airstrikes – after Hamas militants attacked Israeli towns on October 7. At least 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza are unable to access essential health services, and some 5,500 are due to give birth in the coming month, according to the World Health Organisation.\\n\\nTrending Now\\n\\n“If the generator stops, which we are expecting in the coming few hours due to the heavy demands of different departments in the hospital, the incubators in the intensive care unit will be in a very critical situation,” he said. Guillemette Thomas, medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in the Palestinian territories, said some of the babies could die within hours, and others in a couple of days, if they don’t receive the special care and medication they urgently need.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“It’s sure that these babies are in danger,” she told The Associated Press. “It’s a real emergency to take care of these babies, as it is an emergency to take care of the population of Gaza who are suffering from these bombings since the past two weeks.” The hospital must care for patients in northern and central Gaza since several hospitals shut down, he said, forcing it to more than double its patient capacity. That also puts a strain on the limited electricity.\\n\\n(Inputs from IANS)\\n\\nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

A blockade on Gaza has meant dwindling supplies of food, fuel, water and medicine, and U.N. and Arab leaders have called for a cease-fire to allow entry of humanitarian aid that is only trickling in.\\n\\nGaza's Health Ministry on Thursday released a detailed list of names and identification numbers of those killed, including more than 3,000 minors and more than 1,500 women.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\\n\\nMore than 1,400 people were slain in Israel during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, according to the Israeli government, and at least 229 hostages were taken into Gaza. Palestinian militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel, including one that hit a residential building in Tel Aviv on Friday, wounding four people.\\n\\nThe overall number of deaths far exceeds the combined toll of all four previous wars between Israel and Hamas, estimated at around 4,000. A ground invasion is expected to cause even higher casualties on both sides as Israeli forces and Hamas battle each other in dense residential areas.\\n\\nHospitals have been scrounging for fuel to run emergency generators that power incubators and other life-saving equipment after Israel cut off all fuel deliveries to Gaza at the start of the war, forcing its only power plant to shut down.\\n\\nGallant said Israel believes that Hamas would confiscate any fuel that enters. He said Hamas uses generators to pump air into its hundreds of kilometers (miles) of tunnels, which originate in civilian areas. He showed reporters aerial footage of what he said was a tunnel shaft built right next to a hospital.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\\n\\n“For air, they need oil. For oil, they need us,” he said.\\n\\nLittle is known about Hamas' secretive tunnels and other infrastructure, and it wasn't possible to independently confirm Gallant's claims.\\n\\nLynne Hastings, the U.N. aid coordinator for the Palestinian territories, declined to comment on Gallant's remarks, saying “we don't know what Hamas has or doesn't have.”\\n\\n“We have been bringing fuel into Gaza in coordination with the government of Israel for decades. We know fuel is a high-risk item and are working with the Israelis to make sure what we will be using for our operations is done securely,” she said.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\\n\\nThe U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which provides basic services to hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza, said it has been forced to ration fuel among lifesaving machines in hospitals, bakeries, and desalination plants, and only has enough for a few more days.\\n\\n“The siege means that food, water and fuel – basic commodities — are being used to collectively punish more than 2 million people, among them, a majority of children and women,” Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, told reporters.\\n\\nEarlier on Friday, the military said ground forces raided inside Gaza, striking dozens of militant targets over the past 24 hours. It said aircraft and artillery bombed targets in Shijaiyah, a neighborhood on Gaza City's outskirts that was the scene of an urban battle in the 2014 Gaza war.\\n\\nThe military said the soldiers exited the territory without suffering any casualties. It reported an earlier, hourslong raid into northern Gaza on Thursday.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\\n\\nThe damage to Gaza from nearly three weeks of bombardment showed in satellite photos of several locations taken before the war and again in recent days. Entire rows of residential buildings simply disappear in the photos, reduced to smears of dust and rubble.\\n\\nThe Israeli military says it only targets militants and accuses Hamas of operating among civilians in an attempt to protect its fighters.\\n\\nThe conflict has threatened to ignite a wider war across the region.\\n\\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that the Friday strikes in eastern Syria were a response to “ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks” against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria over the past 10 days. He said the operation was separate from the Israel-Hamas war.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\\n\\nHezbollah, an Iranian-backed ally of Hamas in Lebanon, has repeatedly traded fire with Israel along the border, and Israel has carried out airstrikes targeting Iran-linked groups in Syria. The United States has sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the region, along with additional weaponry and personnel, in part to deter Iran and its allies from entering the war.\\n\\nEgypt's military meanwhile said a drone crashed into a building in the Red Sea town of Taba, on the border with Israel, slightly wounding six people. In a separate incident, the state-run Al-Qahera news said a “strange object” landed near a power station in the Red Sea town of Nuweiba, further south. Footage showed debris and smoke rising from the side of a nearby mountain.\\n\\nLast week, a U.S. Navy destroyer in the northern Red Sea shot down three cruise missiles and several drones launched toward Israel by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in northern Yemen.\\n\\nAbout 1.4 million of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have fled their homes, with nearly half of them crowding into U.N. shelters. Hundreds of thousands remain in northern Gaza, despite Israel ordering them to evacuate to the south and saying that those who remain might be considered “accomplices” of Hamas.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT Advertisement\\n\\nOver the past week, Israel has allowed more than 80 trucks with aid enter from Egypt through the Rafah crossing, the only entry point into Gaza not controlled by Israel. But aid workers say the convoys meet only a tiny fraction of the territory's mounting humanitarian needs. Before the war, an average of 500 trucks entered Gaza each day, according to the United Nations.\\n\\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said on social media that it had received 10 trucks of food, medicine and other supplies had passed through Rafah on Friday morning.\\n\\nThe U.S. has been working with other mediators to send in more humanitarian aid, but Israel is insisting on strict screening procedures for all trucks that enter. Hundreds of foreign passport holders are trying to leave Gaza, but the U.S. says Hamas has refused to allow that.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFederman reported from Tel Aviv and Mroue from Beirut.

       " {'articleBody': \"UN chief Antonio Guterres on Tuesday asserted that no party to an armed conflict is above international humanitarian law as he expressed deep alarm over the “relentless bombardment” of the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip by Israeli forces and appealed to all to “pull back from the brink” before the violence escalates even further.\\n\\nThe Security Council ministerial meeting, held under the Brazilian President of the Council, was attended by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Israel’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Eli Cohen, Palestine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Riyad Al-Maliki, Brazil’s Minister for Foreign Affairs Mauro Vieira and France’s Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna among others.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGuterres said he is deeply concerned about the “clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza”.\\n\\n“Let me be clear: No party to an armed conflict is above international humanitarian law.”\\n\\n(Reuters news agency adds: Israel’s UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan described Guterres’ speech as “shocking”.

They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished.

       " {'articleBody': 'NEW DELHI: One of the biggest casualties of any armed conflict is the notion of truth. And nowhere has that adage felt truer than in the recent unrest that has transpired in the Middle East, involving Israel and Hamas. The conflict that has now stretched into its third week has turned social media into a melting pot of misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda.\\n\\nSeveral pages supportive of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza went all out to circulate graphic footage allegedly depicting Hamas’ atrocities. One such video pertaining to a pregnant woman being assaulted by the terrorists had left netizens shell-shocked. Fact-checking confirmed that the said video had nothing to do with the Israel-Hamas stand-off and that it was related to an act of retribution carried out by hitmen in Mexico.\\n\\nMiscreants have also been targeting high profile celebrities, sportspersons and actors, alleging that they have sided with either the Palestinian cause or the Israeli occupation. Representatives of such individuals have in turn taken to social media to refute or clarify their stand on the conflict, considering the potential for off-the cuff remarks snowballing into something serious.\\n\\nThe international community isn’t taking things lying down. Educational institutions in Israel, as well as Jewish schools in America, have urged parents to delete social media apps such as Instagram, TikTok and X (Twitter) from their children’s smartphones to prevent them from witnessing violent footage related to the Israel-Hamas conflict. Stakeholders are concerned how Hamas might weaponise social media and flood various apps with footage of Israeli hostages.\\n\\nWe have seen how videos of two elderly Israeli women kidnapped by the group had gone viral, with messages attempting to reinforce that the captors were being cordial to them. These videos were juxtaposed alongside footage depicting the ‘ruthless’ members of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) dealing with ordinary Palestinian citizens in the aftermath of the recent conflict.\\n\\nIn India, a war of words erupted between the ruling dispensation and the Congress, which had supposedly voiced its support for the Palestinian cause, without taking into account the casualties on the Israeli side. While the BJP termed the development as an episode of the Congress being held hostage to minority vote bank politics, the opposition went on damage control mode, countering it with claims of Atal Bihari Vajpayee espousing the need for political agency for the Palestinians. Needless to say, cyberspace had a field day with numerous iterations of what was said, and what was left unsaid.\\n\\nInterestingly, this week, European Union officials demanded that Meta and TikTok detail their efforts to curb illegal content and disinformation during the Israel-Hamas war, while flexing the power of a new law that threatens billions in fines if the tech giants fail to do enough to protect users. These large tech platforms are now subject to content-related regulations under the Digital Services Act. It requires them to stop the spread of fake news, while addressing the vicious cycle of engagement-driven, algorithmically-recommended content (read boosting the visibility of posts made by verified blue-tick accounts, which can now be purchased for a fee). It wouldn’t be an understatement to regard the unchecked proliferation of fake news on social media as a risk factor for geopolitical instability in the days to come.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'OMAHA — Days after he and his family drew threats from Republican populists for resisting Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan’s push to be House Speaker, U.S. Rep. Don Bacon supported a consensus GOP pick who, like Jordan, voted to reject the 2020 election results.\\n\\nCongressional Republicans unanimously backed Louisiana Rep. Mike Johnson on Wednesday to lead the House following three weeks of party infighting over whether Speaker Kevin McCarthy should have lost his leadership post and who should replace him. Nebraska’s three Republican House members — Reps. Bacon, Mike Flood and Adrian Smith — voted with their GOP colleagues to elect Johnson. Flood and Smith had also backed Jordan. Bacon drew national attention for opposing him.\\n\\nStatements from Nebraska’s House members Rep. Mike Flood, 1st District: “Congratulations to Rep. Mike Johnson on his election to be the next Speaker of the House. He is a principled, constitutional conservative who will do a fantastic job leading House Republicans. We have important work in front of us: America needs to step up and support Israel as they fight back against Palestinian terrorism. We need to keep government running for the people, and we need to continue to deliver on our Commitment to America. I know Speaker Johnson has what it takes to bring the House together around these critical priorities, and I look forward to working together on them in the coming days and weeks.” Rep. Don Bacon, 2nd District: “Speaker Mike Johnson and I came to Congress in 2016 and have served on the House Armed Services Committee together. In the time I have known him, I can say he is a man with a Reagan-like vision for our nation, full of integrity and abounding with decency. We all look forward to getting back to work in the House, and continuing to deliver on the conservative agenda the American people elected us for.” Rep. Adrian Smith, 3rd District: “I’ve known Mike Johnson to be a sincere, capable, and humble leader. A man of faith and stand-up guy who has always been thoughtful, honest and principled, he has the qualities to bring us together and confront the challenges we face as Americans. This afternoon, I was pleased to vote for him for Speaker on the House floor, and under his leadership I look forward to all we can accomplish to get our country back on track.”\\n\\nBacon, in response to a question from the Nebraska Examiner, said he knows that some constituents in his Omaha-based swing district will have trouble seeing differences between Jordan and Johnson. Both are allies of former President Donald Trump who opposed Congress accepting the results of the 2020 election.\\n\\nA retired Air Force brigadier general, Bacon has criticized Johnson and other election deniers since Jan. 6, 2021. No court challenges against the presidential election found evidence of fraud that would have changed a single state’s result.\\n\\nThe Examiner also asked Bacon on Wednesday about Johnson’s longtime opposition to gay marriage.\\n\\n“I can’t say I agree with him on those issues, but we still get to vote our conscience,” Bacon said of Johnson. “He can stand for one thing, and I can disagree or agree. I do know this: He will listen and he is a team player … I trust his character.”\\n\\nJohnson’s vision\\n\\nBacon said Johnson won his vote by talking about a Ronald Reagan-esque vision of conservatism that Bacon said included “peace through strength,” “respect for life” and an optimistic outlook that says “the greatest days for America are ahead.”\\n\\nState Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha said Bacon wasted people’s time by “puffing his chest out on cable news” for three weeks, “only to vote for an agenda of election denialism, Social Security cuts, and a nationwide abortion ban with no exceptions.”\\n\\nVargas, a Democrat, is seeking a rematch with Bacon in 2024.\\n\\n“He will always go with his party bosses, not step up for Nebraska families in need of support,” Vargas said of Bacon.\\n\\nBacon, who serves Nebraska’s competitive 2nd Congressional District, previously supported Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise’s bid for speaker and a later bid by Minnesota’s Tom Emmer. He said Scalise would have been “good” and Emmer “great.”\\n\\nWhy Jordan was different\\n\\nBacon said he opposed Jordan because he and his allies sank Scalise’s bid. Bacon said Jordan’s group bucked House GOP rules saying Republicans should support the person selected by the party caucus. Five Jordan backers refused to support Scalise, the caucus pick, and vowed to support only Jordan. Scalise soon withdrew his candidacy without a floor vote.\\n\\n“Jordan was right there sitting with them,” Bacon said. “So me, (Arkansas Rep. Steve) Womack and a few others said we were never going to support this guy. … That’s not how we operate in a conference. It was really the way he knifed Steve Scalise.”\\n\\nRepublicans’ narrow margin in the House, a 221-212 edge over Democrats that narrows depending on who is absent that day, meant that Jordan couldn’t lose more than a handful of votes.

Moreover, the report claims that the Royal Family may have indirectly benefitted from damaging stories about Meghan Markle.\\n\\nInsiders cited in the report suggest that King Charles was growing increasingly concerned about Harry and Meghan’s ability to command media attention, potentially overshadowing him and other family members.\\n\\n“The undeniable truth is that Harry and Meghan generate more compelling headlines than King Charles, Camilla, William, and Kate. The idea of them remaining in public service but residing overseas, beyond the control of the Royal Institution, and dominating the media narrative, was simply unacceptable,” the article contends.\\n\\nThe report goes on to state that Charles was faced with two options: either allow the Sussexes to maintain a lower profile in the UK or “disentangle them as thoroughly as possible” to minimise the risk of them outshining the rest of the family, according to insiders.\\n\\nREAD MORE: West Bengal minister arrested by ED in multi-crore ration distribution scam\\n\\nTrouble In Funding:\\n\\nFurthermore, the report unveils that King Charles withdrew £700,000 in funding from Meghan and Harry, and encouraged them to embark on a trial year in Canada. This move was prompted by a cash-for-leaks scandal involving journalist Dan Wootton. Byline also alleges that a partner of a key aide to Prince William received £4,000 from The Sun for stories related to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\\n\\nThe Byline report asserts that these allegations emerged from anonymous emails supposedly sent by administrative staff “within the Murdoch newspaper empire,” which disclosed payments linked to stories about Archie’s nannying arrangements and the infamous ‘Megxit’ narrative from January 2020.\\n\\nLegal Battles And Fallout:\\n\\nWhen the Metropolitan Police delved into the leakage allegations, they faced difficulties in securing a warrant to search the properties of royal staff due to the lack of whistleblower identities. In response, Prince Harry issued formal ‘letters before action’ to News UK, outlining claims concerning Wootton and the palace. The Royal Family was uncomfortable with Harry taking legal action against the tabloids.\\n\\nInitially, the royal household believed that the threat of exposure would compel Harry and Meghan to return to the UK, thus maintaining a controlled profile that wouldn’t overshadow the future King. However, the financial cut-off and ensuing legal complications only served to deepen the divisions within the Royal Family.\\n\\nREAD MORE: US hits back at Iran-linked sites in Syria amid Israel-Palestine war\\n\\nThis report aligns with the claims made by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their Netflix docuseries and Prince Harry’s book ‘The Spare,’ underscoring that they were targeted by both the royal family and the press. The revelations have the potential to significantly impact the already strained relationship between key members of the British Royal Family.\\n\\nLike 224 Dislike 28\\n\\n95344\\n\\n0\\n\\n0\\n\\ncookie-check\\n\\nRoyal rift deepens as cash-for-leaks scam tensions rise\\n\\nyes',\n",

As research analyst company GlobalData explains in its 2023 report into tech regulation, large fines are easily “shrugged off” by Big Tech.\\n\\nGlobalData’s patent analytics database between 2020 and 2023 shows that wearable technology that tracks a user’s health has continued to be popular.\\n\\nPublications of related patents have steadily remained above 3000, peaking at almost 4000 in January 2022.\\n\\nBy 2030, GlobalData forecasts that the total global market for wearable technology will be worth $290bn, rising at a CAGR of 14.3%.\\n\\nWhilst smart glasses and VR headsets have remained fairly unpopular due to shorter hype cycles and a lack of appealing use cases, smartwatches make up the second largest wearable tech group behind hearables (wireless headphones and earpieces).\\n\\nGlobalData notes that while smart glasses have failed to become mainstream due to their inability to replace a smartphone, smartwatches paired with a user’s phone have increasingly replaced fitness bands and regular watches.\\n\\nThis ban on Apple is significant, as GlobalData credits the company with creating popular wearables that drive demand due to the Apple brand’s synonymity with fashion and appearance.\\n\\nWriting on Apple’s design in a Medium blog post in 2015, Shahrzad Samadzadeh wrote about Apple’s role in offering its customers an “aspirational lifestyle” through its products rather than cutting-edge technology.\\n\\nReflecting on the 2013 release of the iPhone, Samadzadeh states that Apple used the “visual style” of its phone as the differentiating factor.\\n\\nIn wearable technology, this style feature will be instrumental in generating sales and hype. Companies wanting to dip into the market will need to consider this design element at the forefront of their service, rather than relying on relying solely on pioneering technology.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'The search for a new House Speaker finally concluded on Wednesday with the fourth Republican caucus nominee Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.) prevailing on the floor, earning the vote of every GOP member.\\n\\nNo doubt, the first major issue facing the House right now is President Joe Biden’s emergency spending bill, which includes $60 billion for Ukraine and $14 billion for Israel.\\n\\nThe new Speaker has not commented on how will approach the massive funding bill. When asked about it on Tuesday evening after emerging as the Republican nominee, he told reporters that he was “not doing policy tonight.”\\n\\nA legislative plan that Johnson circulated two days before clinching the Speakership names support for Rep. Mike McCaul’s (R-Texas) resolution condemning Hamas as a top priority, but he does not mention the funding package. However, Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) said on CNN that it was his “understanding” that Johnson was willing to bring the legislation to the floor.\\n\\nWhile sending more aid to Ukraine has proven a key sticking point among Republicans in a series of Congressional debates in recent months, Johnson has not been outspoken on either side of the issue. In the weeks following Russia’s invasion, Johnson supported “debilitating sanctions” on Moscow and posted on X that “America stands with Ukraine.”\\n\\nHowever, by May 2022, Johnson was one of only 57 members to vote against the first tranche of $40 billion in supplemental aid to Ukraine. He released a statement saying, “‘We should not be sending another $40 billion abroad when our own border is in chaos, American mothers are struggling to find baby formula, gas prices are at record highs, and American families are struggling to make ends meet, without sufficient oversight over where the money will go.”\\n\\nHe has consistently opposed aid for Kyiv since then. His voting record has earned him an “F” grade in Bill Kristol’s GOP Congressional Report Card.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the packaging of Israel and Ukraine into one bill has been a divisive question in the Republican caucus, including some who are strong supporters of funding Tel Aviv and Kyiv individually.\\n\\nNine Republican Senators, led by Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) wrote a letter to Senate leadership last week urging them to consider the issues of funding for Tel Aviv and Kyiv separately.\\n\\n“These are two separate conflicts and it would be wrong to leverage support of aid to Israel in attempt to get additional aid for Ukraine across the finish line,” the Senators write. “Furthermore, it would be irresponsible and we should not risk a government shutdown by bundling these priorities together and thus complicating the process and lessening the likelihood of a funding package.”\\n\\nThe letter also notes that “22 Members of the U.S. House of Representatives wrote to the then-leading candidates to be the next Speaker of the House urging them to deny attempts to couple these issues.” The House members who have been opposed to linking the two issues will likely seek to exert similar pressure on Johnson.\\n\\nMany Republicans with similar voting records as Johnson have adopted more aggressive rhetoric than he has toward Ukraine and Biden’s strategy. Given that he — like the rest of the GOP conference — has expressed unequivocal support for Israel — Johnson may be willing to bring the combined package up to a vote.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'A round-up of top newspaper stories\\n\\n#1. European multinationals face tax demands of Rs 11,000 crore after apex court ruling\\n\\nMany multinational companies headquartered in the Netherlands, Switzerland and France could be staring at retrospective tax demands for around Rs 11,000 crore on dividend income repatriated from India after a Supreme Court ruling. The court said that the lower 5 percent withholding tax on dividend income of firms was not available to all OECD countries merely on the most favored nation status.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: India could have been losing Rs 3,000 crore every year on this account. The verdict may also have implications for withholding tax on royalties and fees for technical services.\\n\\n#2. Bond investors seek clarity from market regulator on rating actions by Brickworks\\n\\nInvestors have sought clarity from the Securities and Exchange Board of India regarding the status of rating actions by Brickwork Ratings after the firm sharply downgraded outstanding bonds of some companies. There is uncertainty surrounding the matter following the regulator’s decision in October 2022 to cancel the certificate of registration to Brickwork, which was revoked last month.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: Rating downgrades for bonds have major implications on the profitability of financial entities such as banks and mutual funds. The market regulator needs to swiftly act on this.\\n\\n#3. Early birds report soaring profits in second quarter, revenue growth loses steam\\n\\nThe combined net profit of 213 early bird companies increased by an annualised 21.8 percent to Rs 96,348.5 crore in the three months to September, a rise for the third consecutive quarter but showed a continued slowdown in revenue growth and stagnation in earnings. The combined net sales, or gross interest income for banks and NBFCs of early bird firms increased by 13.6 percent, the slowest growth rate in 11 quarters, to Rs 6.13 lakh crore. It was also the fifth consecutive quarter of declining revenue growth.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: The lagging revenue growth indicates a persistent weakness in aggregate demand in the economy. The slowdown seems severe for manufacturing and non-financial service sectors.\\n\\n#4. Government to review list of banks to be privatised on improved performance\\n\\nThe central government is planning to review the list of state-run banks slated for privatisation amid improved profitability and a significant drop in bad loans. A new panel with representatives from the finance ministry, NITI Aayog and the Reserve Bank of India is being considered to draw a fresh list of candidates for privatisation.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: The bank privatisation exercise in anyway would take place only after the 2024 parliamentary elections. The improved performance of those facing the axe would merit reconsideration.\\n\\n#5. India’s Digital lenders bet on festive season demand to expand business\\n\\nWith the festive season setting in, the digital lending industry is betting big on a quick rebound in business as consumers prepare to loosen purse strings and merchants stock up to meet the additional demand. For digital lending platforms, a demand rebound does not automatically convert into an increase in disbursals, but overall disbursals go up on an average of 15-20 percent during the festive period.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: While the December quarter typically sees consumer-facing businesses making hay, this year the fintech lenders are on a firmer footing to meet the heightened credit demand.\\n\\n#6. Hyundai and vendors line up Rs 10,000 crore to invest in Talegaon factory\\n\\nHyundai Motor India is likely to invest Rs 5,000 crore in General Motors India’s Talegaon plant in Maharashtra, and its vendors are lining up investments worth Rs 5,000 crore near the site. Once the factory and vendors’ facilities begin operations, around 4,500 jobs are expected to be created.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: The investments in phases could only begin once the tussle between workers and management of General Motors is sort out. The workers have been protesting against non-absorption by any future buyer.\\n\\n#7. Probe into Mumbai airport operated by Adani to focus on lapses by GVK\\n\\nThe investigation into the books of the Adani Group’s Mumbai International Airport Ltd and its arm executing the Navi Mumbai airport ordered by the corporate affairs ministry earlier this month will focus on allegations of financial irregularities under the GVK group, its previous owner.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: The Adani Group has disclosed details of the the probe in regulatory filings. GVK has denied any wrongdoing.\\n\\n#8. Israel’s Tower Semiconductor finds no India takers for joint venture\\n\\nIsraeli company Tower Semiconductor’s initial talks with several Indian companies to build a joint venture fab plant that involves the transfer of chip technology have been less than successful. A top Tower management team led by CEO Russell C Ellwanger was in India last week. In 2022, US chip giant Intel, which signed a deal to buy out Tower for $5.4 billion, cancelled it and paid a $353 million termination fee.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: It is unclear why the overtures by Tower Semiconductor has been tepid in India, given that the government is offering all kinds of incentives for the country to emerge as a fab hub.\\n\\n#9. India to take standardised road to charging infrastructure for electric vehicles\\n\\nIn response to the expanding electric vehicle sector in India, the central government is preparing to introduce a standardised charging protocol. This move is a reaction to concerns voiced by industry stakeholders about the absence of uniformity in charging infrastructure that has already led to interoperability issues.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: It is desirable to have uniform standards for the entire electric vehicle industry. The charging infrastructure for two- and three-wheelers is highly fragmented at present.\\n\\n#10. Class of 2024 engineering graduates in India faces cold shoulder from software sector\\n\\nInfosys and Wipro, which together hired 208,000 engineering graduates in the past three years, have no plans to go to campuses in the year to March. It implies TCS and HCL will be the only ones among the big four to hire from colleges. The number hired in 2023-24 is already at an all-time low. Many are giving the ongoing placement season a miss and may look at visiting campuses only after the March quarter.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: The seriousness of the situation can be gauged from the fact that the last time India’s IT firms shied away from campus hiring was during the 2008 global financial crisis.',\n",

He was the fourth nominee in three weeks - chosen after three others won a majority in conference but could not win the GOP votes needed to clinch the gavel on the floor.\\n\\nDailyMail.com breaks down the top challenges new Speaker Johnson faces.\\n\\nSmall staff and limited fundraising experience\\n\\nThe Louisiana Republican and former vice chair of the GOP conference has never chaired a committee and is working with a relatively small staff. Johnson has also only been in Congress since 2016 - a relatively short time compared to previous speakers.\\n\\nHe'll be responsible for trying to heal deep divisions among members and will be forced to work closely with two people who tried to get the top job before him: Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Whip Tom Emmer.\\n\\nSpeakers are typically responsible for rolling in donations to keep and expand the House majority. Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was a prolific fundraiser, as was Nancy Pelosi before him.\\n\\nBut Johnson is not nearly as connected with Washington lobbyists and has only raised $540,000 in all of 2023. That's pennies on the dollar compared to McCarthy's $15.3 haul just from July to September this year.\\n\\nAfter securing the gavel and ending three weeks of House impasse, the newly minted Speaker Mike Johnson faces a long list of hurdles\\n\\nJohnson pictured with his wife and children\\n\\nMotion to vacate threat looms\\n\\nJohnson will also have to contend with whether to change the rule that allowed McCarthy's swift ouster.\\n\\nIn catering to his right wing detractors in January during his tumultuous speaker vote, McCarthy agreed to a single member 'motion to vacate.' That means only one member can call a vote on the House floor to oust the head of the Republicans.\\n\\nThrough that rule Rep. Matt Gaetz filed the motion that ousted McCarthy earlier this month, joined by seven other Republicans and all Democrats.\\n\\nThe rule forced McCarthy to walk a tightrope between appeasing his right wing detractors and working with the Democratic-led Senate.\\n\\nThat will be a tall order for Johnson during next month's spending battle, when the continuing resolution (CR) that prompted McCarthy's firing will expire.\\n\\nBut Freedom Caucus-aligned members who oppose McCarthy have signaled they will give Johnson more leeway.\\n\\n'I'm proud to support our new Speaker Mike Johnson! I'm going to do everything I can to make him successful,' Gaetz wrote on X.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRapidly approaching government shutdown\\n\\nAt the 11th hour before a September 30th deadline, McCarthy put a 'clean' CR on the floor that extended government funding at 2023 levels set under Pelosi for six weeks.\\n\\nThat gave the House more time to pass 12 single subject spending bills to fund each agency of government. But even those party-line bills have proved contentious among the fractured conference, and at some point Johnson will have to work with the Democratic-led Senate to pass negotiated spending bills.\\n\\nJohnson has proposed putting another CR on the House floor to extend government funding until either January 15 or April 15 so the Senate 'cannot jam the House with a Christmas omnibus.'\\n\\nJohnson and his wife in an older photo\\n\\nJohnson opposed the continuing resolution McCarthy put on the floor weeks ago.\\n\\nJohnson's conservative voting record raised questions about how well he will be able to negotiate with the Democratic Senate and White House.\\n\\nRep. Dusty Johnson, a pragmatic conservative from South Dakota, told reporters that Johnson places a high importance on civility.\\n\\nHe said when he came to office, 'Mike Johnson came to my office, sat down with me as a new member and talked to me about how important civility was in this place, how even when we disagree with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we should try to do it as as people who have good faith and good intention with decency.'\\n\\n'That is not something very many members will spend time in these halls, preaching the importance of civility, but I bring that up, because that is at his heart who Mike Johnson is.'\\n\\nJohnson releases his plan for the upcoming appropriations fight\\n\\nJohnson releases his plan for the upcoming appropriations fight\\n\\nUkraine aid debacle\\n\\nJohnson has already pushed through a resolution to support Israel that passed with overwhelming support, and now he'll have to contend with whether to push through more Israel aid amid its war with Hamas and Ukraine aid for its war with Russia.\\n\\nAsked whether he supports Ukraine aid on Tuesday, Johnson told reporters: 'We all do. We're gonna have conditions on that. We're working through it. We'll get you more details.'\\n\\nThe Senate is considering a request from the White House for a Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and border security package.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGeorge Santos' legal woes\\n\\nHe'll also have to contend with how to deal with a resolution to expel embattled Rep. George Santos.\\n\\nNew York Republicans have said they will put forth a privileged resolution next week - triggering a vote that would need to pass a two-thirds threshold within two legislative days.\\n\\nJohnson has declined to say whether he supports the effort to expel Santos. Doing so would put Republicans down another seat in their four-seat majority.\\n\\nAnti-Israel rhetoric by Democrats\\n\\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has also filed a resolution to censure 'Squad' Rep. Rashida Tlaib, claiming she incited an 'insurrection' when she spoke at a pro-Palestinian protest that infiltrated the Capitol campus.\\n\\nGreene called the legislation to the floor by also filing it as a privileged resolution.\\n\\nJohnson has expressed his support for Israel, but it remains to be seen if he'll back Greene's resolution.\\n\\nThe new speaker's first course of action was putting a resolution in support of Israel and condemning the Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7.\\n\\nDemocrats attacks on his denial of the 2020 election and gay rights record\\n\\nDemocrats are already after Johnson's conservative record and involvement in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.\\n\\nJohnson led an amicus brief signed by more than 100 Republicans to a Texas lawsuit seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\\n\\nAsked about his past efforts to overturn the results on Tuesday night, he huffed and told a reporter: 'next question.'\\n\\nRep. Madeleine Dean told DailyMail.com that a colleague told her the only difference between Johnson and Ohio firebrand Jim Jordan is that 'one wears a jacket.'\\n\\nDean predicted Johnson would face the same 'untrustworthy' accusations that were levied against Kevin McCarthy.\\n\\n'He's not somebody who's based in the truth he's very smooth talking. He's clearly bright, but he's not based on the facts and the truth,' she said.\\n\\nThe deeply religious Johnson also spent years opposing gay rights.\\n\\nAs an attorney for the Alliance Defense Fund (ADF), a Christian advocacy group, in 2003 warned that the Supreme Court striking down laws that criminalized homosexual activity went against 'American values.'\\n\\n'There is clearly no 'right to sodomy' in the Constitution,' Johnson wrote in a 2003 column in the Shreveport Times. 'And the right of 'privacy of the home' has never placed all activity with the home outside the bounds of the criminal law.'\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHe was the lead author of the federal so-called 'Don't Say Gay' bill - a 2022 bill that would prohibit federal money from going to 'develop, implement, facilitate, or fund any sexually oriented program, event, or literature' for kids under 10.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had a stern warning for Johnson:\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n'If Speaker Johnson repeats the mistakes of Speaker McCarthy, if he tumbles down the MAGA road, it will be inevitable that the House finds itself trapped in even more chaos very soon,' he said in a floor speech Thursday.

       " {'articleBody': '\\'The New Yorker\\' fact-checked Hasan Minhaj — now he\\'s issued a rebuttal\\n\\nYouTube\\n\\nIt looks a little like a low-key version of one of his Daily Show segments or a piece from his former Netflix series Patriot Act.\\n\\nBut instead, the 21-minute video released by comic Hasan Minhaj, first published Thursday in the Hollywood Reporter, is a personal, detailed rebuttal tackling elements of a critical article about him published by The New Yorker more than a month ago, titled \"Hasan Minhaj\\'s \\'Emotional Truths\\'.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m aware that even talk about this now feels so trivial,\" Minhaj says, noting how the Israel-Hamas War has dominated recent news. \"But being accused of fake racism is not trivial. It is very serious, and it demands an explanation.\"\\n\\nSitting at a desk with graphic images occasionally displayed over his shoulder, Minhaj speaks directly to the camera, asserting that he provided evidence and context to explain why he exaggerated elements in his standup comedy specials, but The New Yorker ignored it. Instead, he says, the story left the impression he had made up or exaggerated racism in his life, which Minhaj strongly denies.\\n\\nHe says he created the video to answer the question everyone is thinking: \"Is Hasan Minhaj just a con artist who uses fake racism and Islamaphobia to advance his career? Because after reading that article, I would also think that.\"\\n\\nA spokesperson for The New Yorker declined to speak on the record about Minhaj\\'s claims, providing a statement which supports their story:\\n\\n\"Hasan Minhaj confirms in this video that he selectively presents information and embellishes to make a point: exactly what we reported. Our piece, which includes Minhaj\\'s perspective at length, was carefully reported and fact-checked. It is based on interviews with more than 20 people, including former Patriot Act and Daily Show staffers; members of Minhaj\\'s security team; and people who have been the subject of his standup work, including the former F.B.I. informant \\'Brother Eric\\' and the woman at the center of his prom-rejection story. We stand by our story.\"\\n\\nThe stakes are high for Minhaj – press accounts say he was considered a front runner for the permanent host of The Daily Show before The New Yorker story was published (Puck News has since reported he was officially informed he will not be getting the job).\\n\\nBut as even he makes clear, his reputation is at stake. Comic Bill Maher, who has been accused of Islamaphobia in his commentary, aired a biting critique during his show Real Time with Bill Maher, saying, \"The stories Mr. Minhaj tells in his act to elicit sympathy for himself as a Muslim and a person of color are completely made up.\"\\n\\nHere are a few important assertions from the video Minhaj has provided.\\n\\nHe says the article implies that race wasn\\'t a factor in why he was dumped by a white classmate just before they were to attend their high school prom — producing emails and text messages between them to insist he was not \"needlessly cruel\" to her in telling the story.\\n\\nA pivotal moment in Minhaj\\'s standup special Homecoming King involves the comic talking about how he was dumped the night of his senior prom, with his date\\'s mother telling him the rest of their family wouldn\\'t understand prom pictures with a brown-skinned boy.\\n\\nIn the video, Minhaj admits that the incident happened days before the dance, but says he was rejected because of his race. The New Yorker story said the woman \"turned down Minhaj, who was then a close friend, in person, days before the dance. Minhaj acknowledged that this was correct, but he said that the two of them had long carried different understandings of her rejection.\"\\n\\nThe story also asserts that he \"shrugged off her concerns\" about people discovering her identity and that that they had a strained friendship. In response, Minhaj presents friendly texts and emails from the woman, and notes that he calls her \"Bethany\" on stage to protect her anonymity.\\n\\nMinhaj says in his new video he did have altercations with undercover law enforcement while growing up, though he does not fully detail the circumstances.\\n\\nThe New Yorker story notes that the comic\\'s 2022 special The King\\'s Jester features a segment alleging Craig Monteilh, a real-life FBI informant who spied on Muslim communities in Southern California, had infiltrated the mosque frequented by Minhaj\\'s family under the name \"Brother Eric.\" Monteilh said that he never visited that mosque or met Minhaj, which the comic acknowledged in The New Yorker story.\\n\\nIn his new video, Minhaj says he did have altercations with law enforcement growing up as a young Muslim man, and he was trying to communicate that experience, apologizing for adding to a dynamic where false stories about police excess can undermine real stories.\\n\\nMinhaj says someone did send him an envelope containing white powder that he opened near his daughter. But contrary to the story he tells in The King\\'s Jester, he knew right away it was not anthrax, the contents did not spill onto her and she was not rushed to the hospital.\\n\\nMinhaj says he and his wife decided to keep the white powder incident secret when it happened – at a time when he was getting pushback on a controversial Patriot Act episode about Saudi Arabia — because they were worried Netflix might cancel the series.\\n\\n\"I am sorry for embellishing the story, if anyone was worrying about me and my family,\" he says in the video.\\n\\nThere are some incidents described in The New Yorker story that Minhaj doesn\\'t address in his new video.\\n\\nThe New Yorker story says, \"Minhaj has elided or concocted other details in his stories, often to place himself more squarely at the center of the action.\"\\n\\nFor example, in The King\\'s Jester special, Minhaj says he met with officials at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., as news broke that journalist Jamal Khashoggi had been murdered at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul. But The New Yorker quotes an unnamed producer who said the meeting took place at least a month earlier.\\n\\nSimilarly, The New Yorker says Minhaj\\'s story about Jared Kushner sitting in a seat that was ceremonially kept vacant for imprisoned Saudi activists at a gala was not true.\\n\\nMinhaj is quoted in The New Yorker admitting that he exaggerated both incidents, but he doesn\\'t address them in his new video.\\n\\nMinhaj\\'s new video and The New Yorker story both turn on the thorny idea of how much accuracy is required from comics who say they are telling true stories about racism, social issues and real people.\\n\\nMinhaj tries straddling a difficult line. He admits that his exaggerations often involve tough subjects like police excess, racism and Islamaphobia — issues more serious than the overstatements made by many typical standup comics. But Minhaj also insists he did not cross the line into inventing his personal experiences with racism.\\n\\nIn his new video, while apologizing for some exaggerations, Minhaj also says there is a difference between how he handles factual material in political comedy shows like Patriot Act and standup specials.\\n\\n\"In political comedy, facts come first,\" he says in the video. \"In comedic storytelling, emotions come first.\"',\n",

The stocks came under pressure during the trade due to concerns about potential interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, the surge in bond yields, and the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine, all of which weighed on investor sentiment.\\n\\nAs per recent media reports, the US 10-year Treasury note briefly touched 5% on Thursday for the first time since 2007, and the Brent Crude futures rose above $93 per barrel on Friday, reaching a level not seen since October 3.

       " {'articleBody': \"The man who became speaker of the House on Wednesday after three weeks of GOP infighting has a solidly conservative voting record that includes opposing both the sweeping toxic exposure bill for veterans passed last year and the Pentagon's abortion policy.\\n\\nRep. Mike Johnson, R-La., won the speakership Wednesday with every Republican vote. He was the GOP's fourth choice for speaker since Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was ousted from the job at the beginning of October, effectively shutting down the House until a new leader was chosen.\\n\\nThe victory marked a rapid rise for Johnson, who joined Congress in 2017 and since 2020 has been the vice chairman of the House Republican Conference, a messaging job that made him the fifth highest-ranking Republican in the House. While he has generally kept a low profile for the last six years, he was perhaps most well-known before Wednesday for playing a leading role in Republicans' efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\\n\\nRead Next: Jet Experienced 'Landing Gear Anomaly' on Runway, Marine Corps Says\\n\\nOn veterans issues, last year he voted against the PACT Act, considered the biggest increase of veterans benefits in a generation that expanded benefits and health care for those exposed to toxic substances during their military service. While some top Republicans ended up supporting the version of the PACT Act that became law, more staunch conservatives continued to oppose it over the estimated $278 billion price tag.\\n\\nJohnson also voted against a year-end package of smaller veterans and military family measures last year. Among other provisions, the bill mandated that states recognize service members and spouses' valid professional licenses from other states and ensured veterans won't lose GI Bill benefits if schools have to close in a future emergency like they did for the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nJohnson has supported major Republican-backed veterans legislation, including the 2018 Mission Act that made it easier for veterans to see doctors outside the Department of Veterans Affairs system.\\n\\nHe also voted for a 2017 bill intended to make it easier to fire problem employees at the VA. The VA said this year it was no longer using the authority granted by the bill because it was rendered useless by years of litigation, infuriating Republicans.\\n\\nJohnson has also backed widely popular veterans bills, including voting for the Forever GI Bill in 2017 and co-sponsoring the Major Richard Star Act, a top priority this year for veterans groups that would give service members who medically retire full access to both military retirement pay and VA disability benefits.\\n\\nJohnson, who was a lawyer before turning to politics, has served on the House Armed Services Committee since 2021.\\n\\nHe has voted for final passage for every annual defense policy bill since coming to Congress, including voting to override then-President Donald Trump's veto of the fiscal 2021 National Defense Authorization Act over its mandate to remove Confederate names from military bases.\\n\\nJohnson has also supported controversial, conservative amendments to the NDAA, including this year voting to ban gender-affirming health care for transgender troops and to repeal the Pentagon policy giving troops travel reimbursements and leave for abortions.\\n\\nIn a letter to his colleagues released shortly before Wednesday's speaker vote, Johnson pledged to pass a House-Senate compromise version of this year's NDAA in December.\\n\\nBy contrast to his regular support for the NDAA, Johnson has voted against nearly every omnibus government funding bill since coming to Congress. Omnibuses combine funding for every government agency into one bill and are typically opposed by conservatives.\\n\\nHe voted against the stopgap spending measure Congress passed last month to prevent a government shutdown. Meanwhile, he supported the House's Pentagon and Veterans Affairs spending bills, which were both packed with GOP policy riders such as provisions to bar abortion services, transgender health care, and LGBTQ+ Pride flags at the VA.\\n\\nAs more Republicans have come out in opposition to Ukraine aid, Johnson has joined them. He voted in favor of amendments to the NDAA and Pentagon spending bill that would have stripped Ukraine funding from the bills and against a stand-alone bill last month to provide Ukraine $300 million.\\n\\nGovernment funding and Ukraine aid will be among his first challenges as speaker. Current government funding expires in less than a month, while the White House has requested Congress also approve roughly $106 billion in funding for Ukraine, Israel, the Indo-Pacific and border security.\\n\\nIn his letter to colleagues Wednesday, Johnson said he would propose another stopgap spending measure to keep the government open past Nov. 17, when current funding expires. His plan would extend funding to either Jan. 15 or April 15, depending on what the majority of the House Republican conference supports.\\n\\nEither date could risk an across-the-board 1% cut to government spending, including at the Pentagon and the VA. Under the deal Congress approved earlier this year to stave off a U.S. debt default, the government must start planning for a 1% spending cut if full-year appropriations bills aren't passed by Jan. 1. The cuts wouldn't actually take effect until April 30.\\n\\n-- Rebecca Kheel can be reached at rebecca.kheel@military.com.

In October 2021, Hezbollah\\'s leader Hassan Nasrallah claimed his organization had a huge 100,000 trained fighters. A year earlier in 2020, the US State Department estimated Iran gave Hezbollah $700million a year. In the past, Iran had historically given $100 million annually to Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

He told a news conference in Tehran: \"I warn the US and its proxy Israel that if they do not immediately stop the crime against humanity and genocide in Gaza, anything is possible at any moment and the region will go out of control.\" Amir-Abdollahian also warned the results could be \"severe, bitter\" and \"have far-reaching repercussions\", both regionally and for those advocating for war.\\n\\nExperience the Express like never before Advert-free experience without interruptions.\\n\\nAdvert-free experience without interruptions.

While the initial attack caught Israeli authorities by surprise, they later fought back with air-strikes on various locations in Gaza and preparations for a massive on-ground offensive are imminent.\\n\\nThe war which became inevitable due to the scale and barbarity of the first offence, has now reached a level where the amount of casualties on both sides is increasing with time. As Israel’s offensive only looks to increase with time, the question is whether the laws of war are being followed in the ongoing operations.\\n\\nAlso read: Explained: Geneva Convention and ‘grave breaches’ against backdrop of Gaza hospital strike\\n\\nA just war?\\n\\nIsrael’s war with Hamas has now reached a level where violence has exacerbated to an extreme level, which looks only to increase. The violence, whatever may be the level of justification given by any side, has incited some level of criticism from different international organisations.\\n\\nThe Israel Defense Forces have been successful in their campaign of air-strikes which have destroyed a spate of weapon warehouses, command centres and tunnels. Their on-ground offensives have also been successful as they have targeted and killed several Hamas commanders and gunmen.\\n\\nWhat remains problematic is that the region of Gaza Strip is densely populated and inevitably has large sections of civilian populations residing there. While major chunks of such populations have been told to relocate from the northern parts of Gaza to its southern parts, there still are complications when it comes to the execution of the on-ground offensives.\\n\\nMuch of this has caused severe damage to infrastructure, with many neighbourhoods damaged beyond recognition. This too has resulted in a lot of injuries and casualties to citizens.\\n\\nThe scale of the offensive has also incited a lot of negative commentary on social media but the major question that remains is whether rules of war are being followed.\\n\\nMany international laws defining rules of armed engagement exist, principally the Geneva Conventions of 1949, which stipulate the humanitarian laws states are bound to follow during times of war.\\n\\nIsrael too is a party to the Geneva Convention. The Geneva Conventions, lists “Palestine” as a signatory party as well, meaning that both sides to this war are bound by the laws of armed conflict.\\n\\nWhat is important to note when it comes to laws such as the Geneva Convention is that these are enforceable and complaints of non-compliance can be filed in international courts and other organisations.\\n\\nWhile Hamas, as a terrorist organisation, does not accept such stipulations, Israel as a democracy does.\\n\\nThe scale of the initial Hamas offensive against Israel also can help understand why their reaction has been so extreme. The early incursion into Israeli territory and the resulting killings of innocent victims and their kidnapping and mutilations is what led Israel to start the offensive.\\n\\nBut being part of many of the international humanitarian organisations and governing bodies, Israel’s code of practice is still intent on avoiding civilian casualties and even the current circumstantial evidence point to that.\\n\\nA major part of the IDF and it’s just behaviour despite the extreme scale of barbarity of Hamas’s attack is that the actions of the Israeli government are ultimately subject to Israeli courts.\\n\\nUnlike the operations of Hamas, the military operations of Israel are conducted at the direction of the government and overseen by the judiciary. It is not arbitrary like that of Hamas.\\n\\nThe level of international scrutiny that the Israeli Army has always been under, has resulted in the IDF giving its soldiers and commanders with education in training of international humanitarian law.\\n\\nIn addition the education of Israeli soldiers, due to the peculiarity of their situation, is all round and far exceeds just military education. From which weapons to use in what context to who is to be destined, how to conduct operations in civilian populations is an ingrained part in the training that Israeli soldiers get.\\n\\nEven after all such precautionary measures, if some allegations of purported war crimes do reach Israeli authorities, they are taken up by independent military and civilian bodies and reviewed by the civil justice system and the Supreme Court.\\n\\nAlso read: Israel-Hamas war: The use of chemical warfare, in the backdrop of accusations from both side in the war',\n",

The purpose of this pause is to allow much-needed aid supplies to reach the people of Gaza, who have been caught in the crossfire of the conflict.\\n\\nBorrell made these remarks as he arrived for a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. He emphasized the urgent need for humanitarian support to be delivered to Gaza, expressing concern for the well-being of Palestinian civilians who have been severely impacted by the violence.\\n\\nThe European Union foreign policy chief\\'s statement follows a similar call from the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres. The international community is increasingly uniting behind the idea that a pause in the conflict is necessary to ensure that essential humanitarian aid can reach those in need in Gaza.\\n\\nDuring the meeting of EU foreign ministers, Borrell addressed the issue, saying, \"I cannot anticipate the result of the meeting, but it is certainly something which the ministers will have to discuss. The Secretary-General of the United Nations asked for it very much. Personally, I think a humanitarian pause is needed in order to allow humanitarian support to come in and be distributed.\"\\n\\nBorrell further elaborated on the matter, highlighting the importance of not only humanitarian aid but also addressing the security concerns in the region. He emphasized, \"The attacks of missiles, rockets from Hamas, from Gaza, have to stop. The hostages, the people who have been kidnapped, have to be released. Obviously, it is part of any step towards de-escalation, and we have to start thinking of how to revive the political process.

       " {'articleBody': 'CNN revealed late Tuesday night new details about how Hamas prepared for its murderous surprise attack on October 7 while hiding it from Israel. According to the report, the planning lasted two whole years and was done by a small cell of operatives in the terrorist organization, who communicated with each other through telephone landlines installed in the extensive network of Hamas tunnels in the Gaza Strip that is nicknamed the \"Metro of Gaza.\"\\n\\n<< Follow Ynetnews on Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | TikTok >>\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nThe Hamas operatives, according to the report, made sure to avoid using computers and other means of communication, such as mobile phones, which Israeli intelligence can more easily track. The CNN report is based on two sources who are familiar with intelligence information that Israel passed on to the US, and it reports that the activities of the cell that was responsible for the preparations for the terrorist attack were kept a secret even from the majority of the terrorists who took part in the invasion of Israel. Although those terrorists underwent a variety of training by Hamas, they were exposed to the specific plan only a few days before its implementation.\\n\\n2 View gallery Palestinian operatives in a terror tunnel under Gaza ( Photo: Reuters )\\n\\nThe Palestinian terrorists\\' use of \"outdated\" communication technology to evade Israeli intelligence is not surprising, and CNN quotes an Israeli source who says that even in Operation Home and Garden operation in the Jenin refugee camp in July, a communication system based on telephone lines was exposed. According to the source, the forces that then raided the refugee camp uncovered a network of closed-circuit surveillance cameras, which were designed to provide early warning of the movements of the security forces, in addition to secure phone lines.\\n\\nThe CNN report is one of several from numerous outlets in the past two weeks that have reported on the intelligence and operational failure that enabled the deadliest terrorist attack in Israel\\'s history, in which 1,400 people were murdered - including babies, children, women and the elderly, and more than 200 were kidnapped to Gaza. Alongside the \"conception\" under which both the political and military levels were convinced that Hamas was \"deterred\" and interested in continuing to receive the economic benefits that were agreed upon with it after Operation Guardian of the Walls in 2021, the public training carried out by Hamas and Islamic Jihad were not seen as significant as far as Israel was concerned.\\n\\n2 View gallery A Hamas military exercise in the Gaza Strip\\n\\nHamas and Jihad did not at all hide these training sessions, in which they practiced more than once taking over Israeli communities, and they even set up bases to simulate them; but Israeli officials did not take this seriously. \"They always train their people this way, it didn\\'t seem different,\" one of the officials told CNN in describing how these trainings were perceived in Israel.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'OPINION:\\n\\nThe terrorist attack on Israel, which killed more than 1,400 Israelis and foreigners and injured thousands, with over 200 hostages, was aided by a complicit Iran that provided training, funding and support to Hamas.\\n\\nIran praised the terrorist attack on Israel, and its foreign minister cautioned Israel to stop its attack on Gaza, warning the war might expand to other parts of the Middle East if Hezbollah joins the battle.\\n\\nLebanon’s Hezbollah, also a proxy of Iran, shares an 80-mile border with Israel and has over 100,000 fighters and tens of thousands of rockets and missiles that could be used against Israel.\\n\\nIn Syria, Iran has established over 50 military bases, using Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ground forces, the Quds Force, and intelligence services to support dictator Bashar Assad’s regime and ensure that Iran can project power beyond its borders.\\n\\nIsrael shares a 40-mile border along the Golan Heights with Syria. It’s obvious that Israel is surrounded by enemies, all supported by a hostile Iran.\\n\\nPresident Biden’s visit to Israel was a vivid display of U.S. support for Israel, as was the deployment to Israel of the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group, followed by the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower Strike Group, in addition to a heightened Air Force fighter presence in the region. This is in addition to the billions of dollars in military aid to Israel that Mr. Biden is asking Congress to approve.\\n\\nIn September 2022, Iran was riveted by massive demonstrations protesting the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, arrested by the morality police for not wearing her headscarf properly. Countrywide demonstrations, led by women and girls, demanded long-denied freedom and equality denied to women, with the slogan “Women, Life, Freedom.”\\n\\nThere was some initial hope that these demonstrations, some of which called for the “death to the dictator,” would have an impact, but the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, supported by loyalist mullahs, brooked no dissent and brutally cracked down on the demonstrations, killing over 500, with hundreds wounded and imprisoned, and at least seven publicly executed.\\n\\nThis is the Iran that supports Hamas, Hezbollah, and its proxies in Yemen, Syria and Iraq. And it will be Iran that will incite a regional war against Israel if Gaza is invaded with an ensuing protracted war, with massive civilian casualties and widespread destruction.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that Israel must respond to Hamas’ horrific terrorist attack and do what’s necessary to free the hostages and destroy Hamas leaders and fighters. That doesn’t preclude, however, seeking a dialogue with the Palestinian Authority, which oversees the West Bank. Or being open to a path to Palestinian statehood while expanding on the Abraham Accords — diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and Kosovo — and seeking normal relations with Saudi Arabia, an issue that obviously concerns Iran.\\n\\nWhat’s obvious is that Iran has not been deterred from using proxies to attack Israel and foment unrest in the Middle East, with the goal of Iran becoming the regional hegemon. A continued robust presence of the U.S. is imperative, as we’re witnessing now with Hamas’ — and by extension Iran’s — terrorist attack on Israel.\\n\\nIndeed, an emboldened Iran, according to the journals Semafor and Iran International, conducted an extensive influence operation in the U.S., working through sympathetic scholars, analysts and influencers for nearly a decade to skew U.S. policy in favor of Iran.\\n\\nChina’s response to the Hamas terrorist attack was a general statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemning harm to civilians and stating that China is a “friend to both Israel and Palestine.” China normalized relations with Iran in 1992 and is buying significant quantities of oil from Saudi Arabia and Iran, more than tripling its imports of Iranian oil in the past two years.\\n\\nA war in the Middle East would adversely affect China and its dependence on Saudi and Iranian oil to fuel its industrial base. And as witnessed in March this year, it was China that facilitated the normalization of relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia. It’s clear that China has interests in the Middle East and wants to be a major player in the region.\\n\\nFor these obvious reasons, the U.S., in its talks with Beijing, could and should encourage China to become more involved in deterring Iran’s destabilizing behavior, especially with its support of Hamas and Hezbollah and its hostility to Israel and its recent terrorist attack on Israel that killed and wounded thousands of civilians.\\n\\nThis message that should resonate with the Chinese people — Israel, a sovereign country, being attacked by terrorists supported by Iran. Hopefully, even Xi Jinping will see the value in trying to moderate Iran’s behavior, given the impact this will have on his nation’s international credibility in dealing with a terrorist Iranian state.\\n\\nThe U.S. should also caution North Korea to refrain from providing weapons — the F-7 rocket-propelled grenade, a shoulder-fired weapon used against armored vehicles — to Hamas, despite denials from Pyongyang. Equally concerning is the reported weaponry North Korea is providing to Russia for its war in Ukraine. North Korea has a long record of selling rockets, missiles and weaponry to Iran, Liby, and Syria for needed cash to pay for their nuclear and missile programs.\\n\\nResuming a dialogue with North Korea to discuss these and other issues should be a priority for the Biden administration.\\n\\nAs President Biden noted in his address to the nation: “American leadership is what holds the world together.” And that leadership requires credible integrated deterrence (diplomatic, economic, and military) throughout the world, especially now.\\n\\n• Joseph R. DeTrani is the former special envoy for six-party negotiations with North Korea (2003-2006) and the former director of the National Counterproliferation Center.

But it turns out something could bring the fractious party together: sheer exhaustion, mixed with the possibility of having to govern with Democrats.\\n\\nOn October 25th Republicans unanimously voted for Mike Johnson, a 51-year-old congressman from Louisiana, to lead the lower chamber. Three previous nominees had dropped out after failing to get the support needed for the job. Mr Johnson, a lawyer and self-described “full-spectrum conservative”, has quietly risen through the ranks on Capitol Hill since arriving in 2017. He held relatively low-key positions in Republican leadership and for two years led the Republican Study Committee, an ideological caucus that counts a large majority of House Republicans as members. Yet Mr Johnson has never even served as a committee chairman.\\n\\nDemocrats who worked with hard-right Republicans to dispose of Kevin McCarthy may have hoped for a more moderate replacement. They are likely to be disappointed with the outcome. Mr Johnson’s congressional website describes him as “a leading defender of the right to life, religious liberty, free speech, the Second Amendment and free-market principles”, and the father of four stands out as a social conservative even within the Republican Party. Compared with Jim Jordan, a mentor whose own speakership bid failed, Mr Johnson has had a little more success sponsoring bills that actually became law.\\n\\nPerhaps most troubling, Mr Johnson has indulged some of his party’s worst impulses in recent years. He voted against certifying the 2020 election results and lobbied House Republicans to support a long-shot lawsuit to invalidate electoral-college votes in several states won by Joe Biden. Will Mr Johnson behave responsibly now that he is in a real position of power—especially as he has to negotiate with Democrats, given Republicans’ slim nine-seat majority in the House?\\n\\nAfter the painful process of finding a leader, Republicans will be eager to avoid such an embarrassing spectacle again. And, lacking Mr McCarthy’s baggage, the new speaker could have some space to compromise. For now, at least, he is operating with some sense of urgency.\\n\\n“We’re going to dispense with all the usual ceremonies and celebrations that traditionally follow a new speakership, because we have no time,” Mr Johnson said minutes after getting promoted. “You’re going to see an aggressive schedule in the days and weeks ahead. You’re going to see Congress working as hard as it’s ever worked.” He added with a smile, “I want to thank you for being patient with us.”\\n\\nThe House immediately moved to pass a resolution condemning Hamas: its first vote will also be the easiest. The first real challenge will be finding a way to fund the government. On September 30th the House passed a bill to temporarily fund it at current levels. This averted a shutdown—but only until November 17th. Mr Johnson voted against the so-called continuing resolution last month, though he showed more pragmatism earlier in the year when he supported a bill that raised the debt ceiling.\\n\\nIn a letter to colleagues on October 23rd Mr Johnson the candidate laid out an ambitious plan to pass a series of spending bills instead of one large long-term funding package. But intraparty fighting has made it hard to agree within the House, let alone negotiate with the rest of the government. “They actually have to pass something and work with the Senate and work with the president,” says Philip Wallach, an expert on Congress at the American Enterprise Institute. “He finds himself in the worst sort of predicament from day one.”\\n\\nMr Johnson acknowledged that the House may need to pass another stopgap bill to fund the government into next year, hoping to “ensure the Senate cannot jam the House with a Christmas omnibus”. (Such a bill would package several measures into one big piece of legislation.) That does not mean a government shutdown is entirely out of the question. Even if Republicans finally agree on legislation, Democrats could find it unacceptable and bet that Republicans would receive more blame for a government closure.\\n\\nThe other urgent matter is the national-security funding request made by Mr Biden on October 20th. The spending package would allocate $61.4bn to fund Ukraine’s defence; $14.3bn for Israel; $13.6bn for America’s immigration crisis; $9.15bn in humanitarian aid for Gaza; and an additional $2bn in foreign support for the defence budgets of countries in Asia. The proposal should easily pass the Senate, which plans to hold hearings on the legislation on October 31st. Yet House Republicans have grown much more sceptical about assisting Ukraine.\\n\\nThe new speaker had yet to reveal his strategy on the national-security request by the time this article was published, but he did call the aid package a “top priority”—a welcome about-turn for Mr Johnson, who has routinely voted against aid for Ukraine. “We have to ensure that Vladimir Putin is not successful,” he told reporters. One possibility will be dividing each of the requests into separate bills and allowing separate votes. But he will have to move cautiously on this given the Republican Party’s isolationist streak\\n\\nOne member of Congress can still call for a vote to oust Mr Johnson, and it would take only a handful of Republicans working with every Democrat to remove him from the speakership. House Republicans certainly want to avoid the chaos and drama of another speakership fight. But if recent weeks have shown anything, it is that their capacity for political self-harm remains unmatched.■\\n\\nStay on top of American politics with Checks and Balance, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.

Many of the releases mentioned below are available now to stream, or you’ll be able to watch them in their entirety by the time Halloween rolls around. There is one docuseries mentioned that does not come out until early November, but given the waning number of new shows arriving due to the writer’s and actor’s strikes, you’ll thank me for this creepy gem about a mom-and-pop cult disguised as an online dating site.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOr you can always watch the news.\\n\\n‘The Fall of the House of Usher’\\n\\nStreaming on Netflix\\n\\nThink of this fantastically creepy offering as “Succession” with metaphysical twists, a wicked sense of comeuppance and blood. Lots of blood. This eight-part Netflix series from Mike Flanagan (“The Haunting of Hill House,” “Midnight Mass”) is loosely inspired by Edgar Allan Poe’s short story of the same name, but its eat-the-rich themes are evergreen. It follows the obscenely wealthy and corrupt founders of a pharmaceutical company, conniving twins Roderick Usher (Bruce Greenwood) and Madeline Usher (Mary McDonnell). We meet them just as Roderick’s greedy and loathsome offspring are dying one by one in barbaric and gruesome fashions. Could it be payback for Fortunato Pharmaceutical pushing addictive painkillers on an unsuspecting public, or is there something even more sinister behind the success of the company and its CEOs? Look toward a mysterious woman from their past, Verna (Carla Gugino). She’s everywhere, all the time, and her name happens to be an anagram of the word raven.\\n\\n‘Shining Vale,’ Season 2\\n\\nNew episodes air Fridays and stream on Starz\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIs Pat having a mental breakdown or is there really a ghost in her new house that’s telling her to kill? Starz‘s half-hour dark comedy “Shining Vale” has fun with every horror trope imaginable while exploring mental illness through the lens of a haunting. “Women are roughly twice as likely as men to suffer from depression,” says the series in an opening disclaimer. “Women are also roughly twice as likely to be possessed by a demon.” Enter Patricia Phelps (Courteney Cox), a bestselling novelist whose follow-up book is way past overdue. Suffering from severe writer’s block and a stale marriage, she and her family move from New York City to the quaint suburb of Shining Vale where she hopes to finish her manuscript and mend her relationship with her emotionally stunted husband, Terry (Greg Kinnear). But the old mansion and its resident ghoul (Mira Sorvino) have other plans. Now in its second season, this sharp-witted series from Jeff Astrof and Sharon Horgan reimagines the many tales of male authors suffering for their craft (“The Shining,” “Misery”) and puts a harried mom and her host of medications at the center of the story.\\n\\n‘The Enfield Poltergeist’\\n\\nPremiering Friday on Apple TV+\\n\\nWhen America had “The Amityville Horror,” England had the Enfield hauntings. A single mum, Peggy Hodgson, and her four kids were terrified by the violent activity in their modest council house on a London estate, and their story would later become the basis of “The Conjuring 2.” But this docuseries from Apple TV+ takes a closer look at the terrifying yet suspicious events that made headlines by mining the 200-plus hours of audio logs made in the home between 1977 and 1978, and comparing old and new interviews with witnesses who claimed to have been rattled by shaking walls, banging doors and flying chairs. This four-part series from MetFilm and Concordia Studios goes as far as to re-create the Hodgson family home on a soundstage, replete with drab beige wallpaper and aging mid-century appliances. As actors lip-sync along to the actual recordings, cracks appear in the story, and that’s where things get interesting. They scrutinize the late paranormal investigator Maurice Grosse‘s findings, calling into question what really caused all the activity that made Hodgson an overnight celebrity in the British press.\\n\\n‘The Devil on Trial’\\n\\nStreaming on Netflix\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nLike “The Enfield Poltergeist,” this documentary looks at the conflicting stories behind a boy’s alleged demonic possession in 1980s Brookfield, Conn. — a case that would mark the first time in U.S. judicial history that a demonic possession was used as a defense in a murder trial. Interviewed here are the folks who actually lived to tell the tale, including David Glatzel, who was 11 years old at the time his family claimed he was possessed (he’s now in his 50s), and his siblings. Together they recall when their brother’s erratic behavior caught the attention of celebrity demonologists and paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, known for their inquiry into the alleged haunting in Amityville, N.Y., and how the chaos in their home led to a homicide that some still blame on a hellish entity. But their conflicting narratives shed new light on the case, and the validity of the first devil-made-me-do-it defense.\\n\\n‘Bodies’\\n\\nStreaming on Netflix\\n\\nIt’s 2023 when Det. Shahara Hasan (Amaka Okafor) finds a dead body in London’s Longharvest Lane. The corpse is an unidentified naked man with a gouged out eye and a curious tattoo. Det. Alfred Hillinghead (Kyle Soller) finds the same body, in the same spot, in 1890. So does Det. Charles Whiteman (Jacob Fortune-Lloyd) in 1941, and Det. Iris Maplewood (Shira Haas) in 2053. They eventually learn that their John Doe’s death is caused by someone traveling backward in time, but why? I’d love to drop a spoiler about this British crime thriller right here, but I won’t because I still don’t fully understand what’s happening in the story that’s based on the DC Vertigo graphic novel of the same name, but that hasn’t stopped me from immersing myself in its unnerving and ominous world. But expect gruesome autopsy scenes from various time periods because bone-snapping gore never goes out of fashion.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n‘Living for the Dead’\\n\\n\\n\\nStreaming on Hulu\\n\\nFinally, a ghost hunting show with something entertaining to lean on when uncooperative apparitions don’t materialize. Hulu’s half-hour reality show follows five queer ghost hunters — a tarot card reader, a witch, a tech guru, a psychic and a paranormal researcher — as they launch investiGAYtions into paranormal activity at various haunted stops across the county. From executive producer Kristen Stewart, who narrates, and the creators of “Queer Eye,” this colorful spin on an old concept aims to “push past boundaries to bring acceptance to the misunderstood — living and dead,” while looking fabulous in the process.\\n\\n‘30 Coins,’ Season 2\\n\\nNew episodes stream Mondays on Max\\n\\nNow in its second season, this biblical, terrifying series from Spain follows exiled priest Father Vergara (Eduard Fernández), an exorcist and ex-convict trying to escape his past in the small Spanish village of Pedraza. But the townfolk begin experiencing supernatural activity of a hellish nature, and it’s linked to an antique coin in Father Vergara’s possession. The silver piece is one of those paid to Judas Iscariot for betraying Jesus and handing him over to the Romans, so suffice to say it’s a bad penny. Enter demons, Vatican conspiracies, animals acting strangely and doomsday deadlines. This season, the battered population of Pedraza faces a new enemy played by Paul Giamatti. Director Álex de la Iglesia describes the villain as “someone so perverse that even the devil fears him.”\\n\\n‘American Horror Stories,’ Season 3\\n\\nStreaming on FX on Hulu\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWait, didn’t “American Horror Story” just return for its 12th season last month? It did, but this is a spinoff of the Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuck hit anthology series, its differences connoted in the last few letters of the shows’ titles. The Halloween special offers a different tale of horror with each new episode, and there are four here to fear. A trailer for the episode titled “Tapeworm,” featuring actor and former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Lisa Rinna, explained what to expect in this splashy logline: “An up-and-coming model will stop at nothing in her hunger for success.” It’s probably best not to snack while watching.\\n\\n‘Escaping Twin Flames’\\n\\nPremiering Nov. 3 on Netflix\\n\\nOK, so maybe this three-part documentary drops after Halloween, but a good cult story is evergreen. This series from director Cecilia Peck goes behind the scenes of a controversial dating site that attracts an online community of mostly single women by guaranteeing it will help them find, and keep, their true soulmate, a.k.a. their “twin flame.” The site is run by the husband-and-wife team Jeff and Shaleia Ayan, and the series features the firsthand accounts of women who allege abusive indoctrination methods, encouragement to stalk their desired flame, and manipulative tactics that made them doubt their very gender and sexual identities. The Twin Flames Universe is still actively recruiting new members, so here’s a chance to witness the horror without paying thousands of dollars in class fees to the Ayans.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBonus watching: Suspenseful series and Hammer Films\\n\\nNella (Sinclair Daniel) in a scene from Hulu’s “The Other Black Girl.” (Wilford Harwood/Hulu)\\n\\nIn case you missed these September releases, “The Changeling” (Apple TV+) and “The Other Black Girl” (Hulu) spin the the unfortunate realities of postpartum depression and racism in the workplace (respectively) into suspenseful tales of gas lighting terror.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnd if you are in the mood for a movie instead, try streaming at least one classic Hammer horror film before handing candy out on the 31st. “Dracula A.D, 1972,” “The Mummy” and “The Devil Rides Out” are just a few of the gothic, often groovy gems that were made by the British Hammer production house throughout the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s. You’ll find them on Max, Amazon Prime and lots of other platforms where Anglophiles appreciate the sinister charisma of Christopher Lee and the gentlemanly ghoulishness of Peter Cushing.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday alleged violations of international law in Gaza and urged an immediate ceasefire as Israel pounds the Palestinian territory in response to Hamas attacks, with the crisis deeply dividing the Security Council.\\n\\nIsrael voiced anger over the UN chief\\'s plea before a high-level session of the Security Council, where the Palestinian foreign minister in turn denounced what he described as inaction in the conflict that has killed thousands on both sides, mostly civilians.\\n\\nOpening the session, Guterres said there was no excuse for the \"appalling\" violence by Hamas militants on October 7 but also warned against \"collective punishment\" of the Palestinians.\\n\\n\"I am deeply concerned about the clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza. Let me be clear: No party to an armed conflict is above international humanitarian law,\" Guterres said, without explicitly naming Israel.\\n\\nGuterres also said that the Hamas attacks \"did not happen in a vacuum\" as the Palestinians have been \"subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation.\"\\n\\nHis remarks infuriated Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen who, pointing his finger at Guterres and raising his voice, recounted graphic accounts of civilians including young children killed in the deadliest single attack in Israeli history.\\n\\n\"Mr Secretary-General, in what world do you live?\" Cohen said. Rejecting tying the violence to the occupation, Cohen said Israel gave Gaza to the Palestinians \"to the last millimetre\" with its withdrawal in 2005.\\n\\nIsrael shortly afterwards imposed a blockade of the impoverished territory, in place ever since, after Hamas took power, and it still occupies the West Bank. Israel\\'s ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, called on Guterres to resign -- writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the UN chief has \"expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder.\"\\n\\n\\'Epic suffering\\'\\n\\nHamas militants stormed into Israel on October 7 and attacked largely civilian targets including families and a music festival, killing at least 1,400 people and taking more than 220 hostages, according to Israeli officials.\\n\\nMore than 5,700 Palestinians, also mostly civilians, have been killed across the Gaza Strip in retaliatory Israeli bombardments, the territory\\'s Hamas-run health ministry said.\\n\\nGuterres, who personally travelled to the crossing between Egypt and Gaza in a push to let in assistance, welcomed the entry of three aid convoys so far through the Rafah crossing.\\n\\nBut Guterres said it was \"a drop of aid in an ocean of need,\" as the UN agency for Palestinian refugees warned it would be forced to stop working Wednesday due to lack of fuel.\\n\\n\"To ease epic suffering, make the delivery of aid easier and safer, and facilitate the release of hostages, I reiterate my appeal for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.\"\\n\\nIsrael, backed by the United States, has rejected calls to halt the offensive, saying it would only allow Hamas to regroup.\\n\\nNew draft, new opposition\\n\\nThe United States last week vetoed a draft resolution on the crisis, saying it did not sufficiently support Israel\\'s right to respond to Hamas.\\n\\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken asked the Security Council to back a new US-led resolution that \"incorporates substantive feedback.\"\\n\\nThe draft, seen by AFP, would defend the \"inherent right of all states\" to self-defence while calling for compliance with international law. It would back \"humanitarian pauses\" to let in aid but not a full ceasefire.\\n\\n\"No member of this council -- no nation in this entire body -- could or would tolerate the slaughter of its people,\" Blinken said.\\n\\nVeto-wielding Russia -- accustomed to being on the receiving end at the Security Council over its invasion of Ukraine -- quickly said it would oppose the US draft, which also came under criticism from US regional ally Egypt.\\n\\n\"We\\'re surprised by new attempts to adopt a resolution that doesn\\'t include any call for a ceasefire to prevent further deterioration of the situation which might lead the region to a dangerous juncture,\" Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said.\\n\\nForeign minister Riyad al-Maliki of the Palestinian Authority, run by Hamas rivals, called inaction by the Security Council \"inexcusable,\" as did Jordan, another US partner.\\n\\n\"The Security Council must take a clear stance to reassure two billion Arabs and Muslims that international law will be applied,\" Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said.\\n\\nJordan and Russia are among nations that requested a meeting Thursday of the UN General Assembly, whose resolutions are non-binding, due to the Security Council deadlock.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Indian stock market today extended its losses for the sixth straight session on Thursday. The benchmark BSE Sensex began the day at 63,774 and swiftly touched an intraday low of 63,119 shortly after the opening bell . In the past six days, the 30-stock index has seen a decline from 66,428 to 63,119, amounting to a loss of over 3,300 points.\\n\\nSimilarly, the Nifty50 started off on a weak note for the sixth straight day on Thursday, hitting an intraday low of 18,843, which translates to a loss of approximately 970 points over this period. The Bank Nifty index also opened lower at 42,708, quickly dropping to an intraday low of 42,105, shedding around 2,300 points.\\n\\nOn why share market is going down for the last six straight sessions, V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services said, “There is risk-off in global equity markets triggered by a combination of economics and geopolitics. The Israel-Hamas conflict continues to be a major headwind for markets. If the conflict lingers for long it has the potential to impact global growth, too, when the global economy is already in the midst of a slowdown. In the near-term, however, the strongest headwind for the market is the stubbornly high US bond yields. With the 10-year bond yield at near 5% FPIs are likely to be in the sell mode. Sectors like banking and IT which constitute the largest segments of the AUM of FPIs are likely to be under pressure. This will provide opportunities for long-term investors to buy quality stocks, particularly in banking, at attractive rates.\"\\n\\nAsked about the reasons for share market downtrend, Avinash Gorakshkar, head of research at Profitmart Securities listed out the following six reasons:\\n\\nIsrael-Hamas war\\n\\n“Israel-Hamas war has entered 20th day and still there is no possible solution visible at current moment. This tension in the Middle East region has put uncertainty in the minds of investors, which has triggered panic selling across bourses,\" said Gorakshkar.\\n\\nRising US Treasury yield\\n\\n“After hitting record 16-year high of over 5 per cent, 10-year US bond yield witnessed some retracement on Tuesday but it has been rising continuously since Wednesday and now it has once again come close to 5 per cent levels. This has put pressure on global markets including Dalal Street,\" said Gorakshkar.\\n\\nRising US dollar rates\\n\\nGorakshkar went on to add that US dollar index had came below 106 levels but it has also witnessed sharp upside movement in last two days and now it has not just regained the psychological 106 levels but it has come close to 107 levels, which an alarming situation for global equity markets including Indian stock market.\\n\\nParticipatory selling\\n\\nProfitmart Securities expert went on to add that selling is not just restricted to large-cap index but in broad market as well. This has pulled down key benchmark indices.\\n\\nIn last four days, small-cap index has shed over 3,200 points whereas mid-cap index has fallen to the tune of 1,950 points in this time.\\n\\nFIIs\\' selling\\n\\nGorakshkar went on to add that FIIs have been continuously selling in Indian equity market as US dollar has been rising continuously in last few weeks. In such a scenario, they might be shifting their money from emerging markets to other assets like gold, bond, currency, etc.\\n\\nIn October 2023, FIIs have sold out stocks worth ₹17,396 crore till 25th October 2023. On Wednesday session, FIIs sold Indian shares worth 4,236 crore.\\n\\nInflation concern\\n\\nProfitmart Security expert went on to add that rising crude oil prices are also a concern for Indian stock market as it would raise inflation in India if the crude oil continues to remain in uptrend due to Middle East tension. He said that India imports near 85 per cent of its demand for crude oil and hence rising crude price is a sign of danger for Indian inflation and economy.\\n\\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

The US, Germany and more than 40 other governments have formally adopted or endorsed the IHRA definition of antisemitism.\\n\\nGaza conflict could end fragile Israel-Turkey rapprochement To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\\n\\nValansi also said antisemitic tendencies in public discourse, such as comments glorifying Adolf Hitler and Nazi ideologies, were resurfacing, causing a sense of insecurity among Jewish Turks.\\n\\nMore than 1,400 Israelis have died following the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas and allied groups, according to Israeli authorities. More than 7,000 people have been killed in Gaza in Israeli strikes in the last three weeks, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.\\n\\nHamas has been designated a terror organization by the European Union, the US, Germany and other governments.\\n\\n\\'Enmity and hatred\\'\\n\\nAs civilian deaths have amplified the tensions, some newspapers in Turkey have been accused of promoting a sense of war.\\n\\n\"There are newspapers that are almost shouting war cries,\" Faruk Bildirici, an independent ombudsman and media commentator who spent nine years as the readers representative of the national daily newspaper Hurriyet, told DW.\\n\\nYeni Safak headlines: \\'This Terror State Must Be Destroyed\\' and \\'The Ummah is Standing\\' Image: Yeni Safak\\n\\nOn October 18, following the attack on the al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza, the front page of the pro-government daily Yeni Safak, a Turkish had the headlines: \"This Terror State Must Be Destroyed\" and \"The Ummah is Standing\" — ummah refers to the global Muslim community.\\n\\nBildirici raised concerns about framing the conflict as an interreligious war, noting this would further fuel animosity.\\n\\nPortraying \"what is going on as \\'the ummah standing up\\' means that the war is being viewed and portrayed as a war between the West and the East or between Islam and Christianity/Judaism,\" Bildirici said. \"This fuels enmity and hatred against the West and Christianity/Judaism.\"\\n\\nOn October 17, the pro-government Islamist daily Yeni Akit targeted Jewish Turks with the front-page headline \"Deport the Zionist Servants from Citizenship.\"\\n\\nYeni Akit claimed that Jewish Turks are \"considered citizens of Israel by nature\" and, therefore, are going to Israel from cities such as Istanbul and Izmir to join the military service during the war.\\n\\nAvlaremoz, a news and opinion website focused on Jewish affairs and antisemitism in Turkey, criticized Yeni Akit for coverage that does not reflect the truth.\\n\\nAntisemitism spreads online\\n\\nHashtags such as #TürkiyeYahudileriVatandaşlıktanAtılsın (Expel Turkish Jews from citizenship) have arisen to target people who post about Israel.\\n\\nJewish artists and writers, even those not active on social media, have faced criticism for not publicly supporting Palestine.\\n\\nThe Jewish community within Turkey has broadly advocated for peace.\\n\\nIn a statement released on October 18, the Turkish Chief Rabbinate Foundation-Turkish Jewish Community wrote: \"We strongly reject and condemn the targeting and killing of innocent civilians under any circumstances and wherever they are — particularly in places like hospitals, schools [and] nursing homes.\\n\\n\"We support the efforts of our state, the Republic of Turkey, since the first day to urgently restore peace and wish that all people can be brought to a lasting peace as soon as possible.\"\\n\\nAntisemitism in politics\\n\\nSome Turkish politicians have also turned to antisemitism in their rhetoric.\\n\\nAddressing the Israel-Hamas conflict during a meeting of the parliamentary group of his Justice and Development Party (AKP) on Wednesday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan referred to Hamas as a \"group of mujahedeen,\" an Arabic meaning those fighting for Islam, rather than a terrorist organization. Erdogan also said he had canceled plans to visit Israel.\\n\\nAKP and opposition politicians alike have shown their support for Hamas since the conflict began. On Tuesday, Devlet Bahceli, the leader of the Nationalist Movement Party, another of Erdogan\\'s alliance partners, called on Turkey to intervene in the conflict militarily to protect Gaza if a cease-fire cannot be achieved within 24 hours.\\n\\nSo far, there have been no large-scale organized demonstrations in Turkey against the Israel-Hamas conflict. However, riot control vehicles are waiting in front of the synagogues in Turkey for security purposes.\\n\\nAfter the hospital explosion in Gaza, different groups gathered in front of the Israeli consulate in Istanbul and the embassy residence in Ankara to protest.\\n\\nSome protesters in Istanbul shouted \"takbir,\" an Islamic chant that means \"God is the greatest,\" and broke through the outer walls of the plaza where the Israeli consulate was located.\\n\\nTurkish protesters in Ankara marched on October 18 holding a sign reading \\'No to Genocide\\' Image: Adem Altan/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nAKP\\'s Istanbul branch announced that a \"Great Palestine Rally\" will be held on October 28 at Istanbul Ataturk Airport.

       " {'articleBody': 'Morning Scan: All the big stories to get you started for the day\\n\\n#1. Markets slump for fifth straight session on sustained selling pressure\\n\\nIndian equities extended their fall for a fifth consecutive session on sustained selling by foreign and retail direct investors amid rising bond yields in the US, the Israel-Hamas war, and rising crude prices. Both Sensex and Nifty declined more than 0.8 percent as overseas investors sold shares worth Rs 4,236.6 crore. The plunge in the past five trading sessions has eroded investor wealth by Rs 14.45 lakh crore.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: There could be more pain ahead as stocks may fall further unless external cues improve. Retail direct investors are leaving the market in large numbers on fears of a sharper correction.\\n\\n#2. Dozen companies to soon seek Rs 15,000 crore through initial public offers\\n\\nAbout a dozen companies are set to seek more than Rs 15,000 crore through public offerings in the coming month. Several aim to do so ahead of Diwali on November 12. While Cello World and Blue Jet Healthcare have announced their IPO dates, firms such as Tata Technologies, Mamaearth, ASK Automotive, Protean eGov Technologies, Fedbank Financial Services, ESAF Small Finance Bank, Flair Writing Industries and Credo Brands Marketing, among others, are in the pipeline.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: Corporates seem to be undeterred by the pronounced volatility in the secondary market. Retail appetite could run low but institutional investors have shown keen interest in roadshows.\\n\\n#3. Gold sales surge by over 30 percent despite a spike in prices after Israel-Hamas war\\n\\nDespite prices of gold moving up by 5.5 percent since outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Palestine, sales have surged by up to 30 percent during Dussehra-Navratri period compared with last year, according to jewelers such as Malabar Gold & Diamonds, PNG Jewellers and Senco Gold & Diamonds. Gold prices, which stood at Rs 57,415 per 10 gm before the conflict in West Asia, have risen to Rs 60,612 in a fortnight.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: Demand for the yellow metal is traditionally insatiable in India. The recent surge in purchases could also be a protective move in anticipation of a further rise in prices.\\n\\n#4. Reserve Bank orders private banks to have at least two whole time directors\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India has directed private lenders them to have at least two whole time directors. Lenders that do not meet the requirement will have to submit the names for the banking regulator’s approval within four months. Many private lenders and overseas banks that do not meet the requirement and will have to take immediate action.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: The move by the central bank is aimed at strengthening governance in private banks and wholly owned subsidiaries of foreign banks.\\n\\n#5. Finance Ministry starts review of divestment schedule amid high market volatility\\n\\nThe finance ministry is reviewing its disinvestment schedule after the recent stock market selloff amid high volatility triggered by global factors. The central government is likely to adopt a prudent selloff approach and will desist from divestment for the sake of divestment. The government will remain mindful of the right price for its assets as well as the interests of investors, officials said.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: The government is reconsidering putting state-run banks on the block as their performance has improved. Market volatility has made it cautious on selling stake in other state-owned firms as well, which could upset its divestment targets, which it has missed for the past few years.\\n\\n#6. Gambling and gaming firms receive tax notices worth over Rs 1 lakh crore\\n\\nOnline gaming platforms and casinos have been sent notices to reclaim over Rs 1 lakh crore in goods and services tax, but the recovery will depend on what the Supreme Court decides on the dispute. The notices were sent by the end of September. Notices after the first audit of GST returns have also gone out to sectors like automakers and insurers for dues on their tax payments.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: Tax authorities may not launch an aggressive recovery drive before the top court decides the fate of 28 percent GST on online gaming companies.\\n\\n#7. India seeks carbon tax concessions from the UK in proposed free trade pact\\n\\nWith the UK preparing to roll out a carbon tax for goods entering the country, India is negotiating for the proposed free trade agreement between the two nations to include provisions that may offer some relief to local exporters. Britain plans to implement the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism over the next two-three years as part of its efforts to combat climate change.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: The European Union is also implementing a similar carbon tax. These moves are seen as a tariff barriers by exporters in emerging economies such as India.\\n\\n#8. Maharashtra sends notices to Tata Consultancy over delay in onboarding lateral hires\\n\\nTata Consultancy Services has received a notice from the Maharashtra government’s ministry of labor and employment regarding the company’s delay in onboarding lateral recruits. The complaint was filed by the Pune-based IT employees’ union called Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate in July.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: Industrial action by labor union in the software sector is rare in India. This comes at a times when top IT companies are going slow on hiring as clients in key markets tighten purse strings.\\n\\n#9. Government hires Boston Consulting to help prepare blueprint for 2047 vision\\n\\nThe government has hired Boston Consulting Group to help prepare the Vision 2047 document that will set India’s medium-term goals and priorities for becoming a developed economy in the next quarter century. The vision document, expected to be unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will outline an economic strategy towards becoming a middle-income nation by leveraging India’s strengths in industry, services, agriculture, trade, and human capital, while improving the governance systems and access to public goods.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: India has come a long way, from abolishing the Planning Commission that designed the country’s mid and long-term goals to hiring a private consultancy for a national vision.\\n\\n#10. India Inc increasingly coopting independent directors as chairman as governance strategy\\n\\nJio Financial Services, Asian Paints, Crompton Greaves, Tata Technologies, Axis Bank and Federal Bank are among a growing list of companies that have appointed independent directors as chairmen to foster the idea of equitable treatment for all stakeholders. Most of them are people of stature and experience in their respective fields. Infosys was one of the early movers in this regard, appointing KV Kamath, R Seshasayee and Ravi Venkatesan to the position at various times.\\n\\nWhy it’s important: Several large and progressive companies following good governance practices are looking to send a message to investors about a transparent culture and mindset. It a welcome move.',\n",

This decline has been on the back of the Israel-Palestine conflict, rising bond yields, a strong dollar, a surge in crude oil prices and continuous outflows by foreign investors.\\n\\nJP Morgan believes that EM equities face challenges as US long rates rise and the dollar impacts growth and rates. A sustainable bid for EM equities may only emerge once the US completes its cycle with a GDP recession and rate cuts, it stated.\\n\\nBefore JP Morgan, other global brokerages, Morgan Stanley and Nomura, also upgraded their India ratings to ‘overweight’ whereas CLSA increased its India portfolio allocation by 20 percent.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley upgraded India\\'s rating citing that the relative economic and earnings growth is improving and the macro-stability setup looks sufficient to withstand the higher real rate environment.\\n\\n“India remains standout overweight. We increase our overweight stance on Indian equities and as our most-preferred emerging market,\" it said.\\n\\nApart from this, Morgan Stanley said that the ‘dream run’ of domestic flows continues and multipolar world dynamics are driving both FDI as well as portfolio flows towards the country, adding that the domestic equities top the brokerage\\'s global equity investment score with an overall score of 68.\\n\\nGoing ahead, MS expects the BSE Sensex to reach 68,500 points by December. It said Sensex will trade at a price-to-earnings multiple of 20.5 times compared to a 25-year average of 20 times. The premium over the historical average reflects greater confidence in medium-term growth, noted the brokerage.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Nomura said, \"The structural story of India is now well known as a major beneficiary of the “China+1\" theme, possessing a large, liquid equity market. We see the recent softness driven by higher oil prices as an opportunity to raise exposure. While this weakness may persist in the near term, we think the window of opportunity might not be open for too long. Valuations are expensive but will likely remain so in a scenario of policy/government continuity.\"\\n\\nOther countries\\n\\nJP Morgan also upgraded Saudi to ‘overweight’ due to premium oil prices, uncertainty, a strong dollar, and equity market de-rating.\\n\\nHowever, it downgraded South Korea to ‘neutral’ due to profit-taking, higher US rates, slowing demand, and less accommodative monetary policy.\\n\\nMoreover, it mentioned that it plans to allocate its risk budget to overweight China, in addition to Saudi and India, due to attractive growth momentum, low investor positioning, and favorable valuations.\\n\\n\"Exciting news!

Decent Q2 results in India, which were in line with optimistic estimates, may also support the market\\'s rebound. However, the volatility of the global market is expected to delay the recovery trend of the domestic market, since the global market is focused on the risk of further slowdown of the global economy due to elevated interest rate and geo-political tension. Amidst the ongoing market consolidation, sectors such as FMCG, consumption, fertilizers, and core segments like infrastructure, housing, are expected to present potential growth opportunities.

In that scenario, Sino-Indo relations would likely deteriorate even further and faster than before if Beijing feels emboldened by its newfound edge over the Siliguri Corridor to redouble its claims to Arunachal Pradesh.\\n\\nChina and Bhutan appear to be on the brink of formally establishing relations after their Foreign Ministers’ meeting in Beijing on Monday. The first said that it’s ready to resolve their long-running border dispute while the second pledged to uphold the one-China principle and praised his host’s Global Development, Security, and Civilization Initiatives. The Chinese-Bhutanese rapprochement is mutually beneficial, but it could have serious implications for India as will be explained in this piece.\\n\\nThat South Asian Great Power is concerned that any resolution of those two’s border dispute that results in Chinese control over the Doklam Plateau (known as Donglang by Beijing) could give the People’s Republic the military edge over India in the event of another war between them. This slice of territory overlooks the “Siliguri Corridor” connecting “Mainland India” with the “Seven Sisters”, which is only 12-14 miles wide at its narrowest point, hence why it’s nicknamed the “Chicken’s Neck”.\\n\\nIndia dispatched troops to Bhutan in summer 2017 to stop China’s construction of a road in this disputed region in accordance with its decades-long defense cooperation with that Kingdom, which objected to what it claimed at the time to be Beijing’s unilateral change of the status quo. Although the crisis ended with mutual de-escalation measures, it set the stage for the lethal Sino-Indo clashes that broke out three years later in the disputed Galwan River Valley, and their ties were never the same after that.\\n\\nEach consequently regards the other as a rival, which has greatly impeded their cooperation in multipolar fora like BRICS and the SCO despite their shared Russian strategic partner’s best efforts to bridge their differences or at least decelerate the pace at which they continue widening. Another Sino-Indo war therefore can’t be ruled out even though neither wants this to happen, but it could still occur by miscalculation owing to their tense security dilemma that’s only worsened over the past year.\\n\\nChina continues to claim the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh on the basis that it constitutes “South Tibet”, hence Delhi’s concerns that the “Seven Sisters” could once again be the scene of fighting if another war breaks out. In that scenario, China could threaten India’s supply lines through the Siliguri Corridor from Doklam, and it can’t be taken for granted that Bangladesh would allow India transit rights. Even if it did, anti-Indian elements could organize crippling protests and even attack those convoys.\\n\\nThese calculations explain why India militarily intervened in Bhutan’s support to stop the construction of a Chinese road in disputed Doklam over half a decade ago, and it’s precisely because they remain enduring that India is so concerned about the possibility of Bhutan potentially ceding Doklam to China. Considering that China reaffirmed its claims to that region as recently as August after the publication of its annual map, there’s no reason to expect that it’ll drop its request for the plateau’s cession.\\n\\nIn the event that Bhutan swaps that territory with China in exchange for Beijing’s recognition of Thimphu’s sovereignty over other disputed parts of their border, then India would be placed in a difficult position. China’s resultant military edge over the Siliguri Corridor could embolden it to double down on claims to Arunachal Pradesh, which could be pushed to pressure India to drop its own claims elsewhere along their disputed border in exchange for Chinese recognition of India’s control over that state.\\n\\nThe optics of China pressuring India in such a way could also be exploited by the latter’s opposition to portray the BJP as weak ahead of next spring’s elections, especially if they spin Bhutan’s potential cession of Doklam as “the latest domino to fall” after the Maldives just elected a pro-Chinese leader. Coupled with the possibility of the Indian-friendly Bangladeshi government being deposed after next January’s elections, this narrative might become more compelling to a larger number of voters by then.\\n\\nViewed from this perspective, any successful Chinese-Bhutanese rapprochement that results in Thimphu ceding Doklam to Beijing would have both military and political consequences for India, but there’s little that Delhi can do to stop it since such a deal would be between sovereign states. In that scenario, Sino-Indo relations would likely deteriorate even further and faster than before if Beijing feels emboldened by its newfound edge over the Siliguri Corridor to redouble its claims to Arunachal Pradesh.\\n\\nThere are three reasons to expect that the People’s Republic might pursue the aforesaid course of action upon obtaining control over Doklam. First, China wants to discredit India’s self-described role as the Voice of the Global South by pressuring developing countries to choose sides between them if another crisis breaks out. Many of them might back Beijing solely because it’s their top trade partner and they don’t want to risk getting on its bad side, which would thus undermine Delhi’s claims of leadership.\\n\\nThe second reason concerns China’s desire to resolve the western half of its border dispute with India on favorable terms to Beijing by leveraging a crisis over Arunachal Pradesh to that end as was explained. China could redouble its claims to that region in order to pressure India into agreeing to a compromise whereby Beijing drops these selfsame claims in exchange for India dropping its own over the Chinese-controlled part of Ladakh that Beijing calls Aksai Chin. This is risky, however, and might backfire.\\n\\nThat brings everything around to the last reason why China might redouble its claims to that region if it obtains control over Doklam since it could be that the People’s Republic wants to shape the narrative that the BJP is weak ahead of next spring’s elections as punishment for refusing to compromise on their dispute. What’s so dangerous about this is that the ruling party might respond more forcefully than China expects, which could lead to another lethal clash or even a war in the worst-case scenario.\\n\\nNeither China nor India wants to fight one another once again, but the former’s control over Doklam could be perceived by the latter as a game-changer that’ll either force it into compromising against its ruling party’s will or contemplating preemptive military action, thus worsening their security dilemma. China doesn’t want war since that’ll play into the US’ claims that it’s part of a new “axis of evil”, while India can’t rely on US support if need be since it’s already overstretched supporting Ukraine and Israel.\\n\\nNevertheless, the further deterioration of their ties that’s expected in the event that China obtains control over Doklam as part of its ongoing rapprochement with Bhutan means that these concerns are disturbingly credible, which is why everyone should closely follow the interplay between those three. Amidst the NATO-Russian proxy war in Ukraine and the latest Israeli-Hamas war, another Sino-Indo war could throw the world into complete chaos, which is why it should be avoided if at all possible.\\n\\n(The article was published on Korybko.substack.com on October 24, 2023 and has been reproduced here)',\n",

This strike comes after the rise in attacks against US forces deployed in the Middle East.\\n\\nUpdated Oct 27, 2023 | 10:53 AM IST\\n\\nUS Strikes 2 Iran-backed Militia Facilities in Syria, confirms Pentagon Photo : AP\\n\\nWashington DC: The United States has stated that it struck two Iran-backed militia facilities in Syria. The airstrikes have been confirmed by the Pentagon today. US Defence Secretary Llyod Austin stated the strikes were carried out after a series of drone and rocket attacks were witnessed against US Forces in the Middle East.\\n\\nAs per the official statement issued by the Defence Secretary, the facilities have been used by Iran\\'s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and other affiliated groups. As per CNN, Austin described US actions as \"narrowly tailored in self-defence\".\\n\\nThe Defence Secretary further elaborated that these strikes were not part of the Israel-Gaza conflict but due to a different concern of the US. Since October 17, US forces deployed in the Middle East have been subject to various drone and rocket attacks at the hands of militant groups such as the Houthis, which are backed by Iran.\\n\\nIn Iraq, American forces have been attacked around 12 times and around four times in Syria. These strikes carried out as a response to these attacks.\\n\\nAustin has accused Iran of being directly involved in the attacks against US forces. \"Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces. We will not let them,\" stated the Defence Secretary.\\n\\nEarlier on Thursday,the US government also announced that it will deploy around 900 troops in the Middle East and may increase the amount in the coming future.\\n\\nUnder President Joe Biden, the United States has carried out strikes against militias before. However, this strike comes at a time when tensions are already high in the Middle East. The US is working towards sending a strong message to Iran and the militant groups backed by them. The aim of this message is to warn Tehran to not escalate tensions in the region.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'The Pentagon has announced that the US is dispatching a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system and additional Patriot air defense missile system battalions to the Middle East in response to the latest attacks on its troopers.\\n\\nSince the United States started moving its military assets to the region, beginning with the world’s largest aircraft carrier, USS Gerard R. Ford, it has emphasized that the deployment is meant to prevent escalation. With Israel hinting it is set to launch a ground invasion of Gaza, Washington fears a much bigger regional conflict.\\n\\nThe concerns of a wider regional conflict are conflated with the Lebanon-based Hezbollah group launching sporadic attacks on Israel, with the latter warning that the militant group Iran allegedly supports risks dragging Beirut into the conflict. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) conducted overnight air strikes on Southern Lebanon on October 22.\\n\\nOver three weeks after the Hamas attacks on October 7 that killed 1,400 Israelis, including women and children, the IDF has incessantly carried out bombing runs on the Gaza Strip, reducing the densely populated city to rubble and killing 4,500 people in the enclave.\\n\\nWith the Jewish State pledging to decimate Hamas, the IDF has amassed tanks and troops near the fenced border for a planned ground invasion that is speculated to begin soon.\\n\\nThe imminent ground operation has triggered fears of an all-out regional conflict that could see countries like Iran becoming a party. The decision to deliver these weapons, particularly the THAAD battery, to Israel is part of a more extensive operation to position much more firepower in the region if Iran or its proxies intervene in the battle against Hamas and Hezbollah.\\n\\nThat the United States feels most threatened by Iran and its proxies in the region became evident through Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s statement detailing the deployment.\\n\\nAustin said, “Following detailed discussions with President Biden on recent escalations by Iran and its proxy forces across the Middle East region, I directed a series of additional steps to strengthen the Department of Defense posture in the area today. These steps will bolster regional deterrence efforts, increase force protection for US forces in the region, and assist in the defense of Israel.\\n\\n“I have also activated the deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery and additional Patriot battalions throughout the region to increase force protection for the US forces.”\\n\\nTo add to the prevailing precarious situation in the Middle East, the US troops came under a spate of attacks last week. Several US positions in Iraq and Syria were attacked by drones, with some of its forces sustaining minor injuries. One contractor died of a cardiac arrest while taking shelter from these attacks.\\n\\n📸: On Oct. 19, the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Carney (DDG 64) took out multiple Houthi missiles & unmanned aerial vehicles in the Red Sea 🌊.

The Iran-backed Houthi group in Yemen is believed to have fired the missiles and launched the drones to target Israel.\\n\\nThese incidents make the US THAAD and Patriot air defense systems deployment in the Middle East significant.\\n\\nFor perspective, THAAD aims to intercept ballistic missiles as they leave the midcourse phase of their flight and approach their targets later in their attack profiles. It supplements the Patriot’s upper-layer anti-ballistic missile defense system in many theatres since it can intercept more powerful, swifter, and farther-flying ballistic missiles at longer ranges.\\n\\nThe THAAD is in operation in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and was used for the first time last year. Besides the THAAD and Patriots, the United States has sent significant naval power to the Middle East in recent weeks, including two aircraft carriers, their auxiliary ships, and about 2,000 Marines. This has been touted as the most significant build-up in the region in recent years.\\n\\nOn its part, Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has warned Israel fiercely that failure to halt its bombardment of Gaza could result in an uncontrollable situation in the Middle East. Iran has maintained the position that the US was to “blame for” providing military aid to Israel.\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop of intense military activity in the region, Iran has also upped its force projection by amplifying new capabilities and issuing fierce warnings to its age-old rivals, Israel and the United States. This includes arming a cutting-edge drone with lethal missiles.\\n\\nIranian Drone Equipped With A Brand-New Air Missile\\n\\nAmid tensions running high in the region, the Iranian Air Defense Force commander, Brigadier General Alireza Sabahi-Fard, announced on October 21 that experts have modified a domestic surface-to-air missile for use with the “Karrar” jet-powered drone.\\n\\nBrigadier General Alireza Sabahi-Fard stated that the Air Defense Force has successfully fitted the Karrar drone with a “Majid” heat-seeking air-to-air missile with an 8-kilometer range, Tehran Times reported.\\n\\nHe informed the media that after eighteen months of study and testing, the Air Defense experts converted the Majid surface-to-air missile into an air-based weapon through a series of technological modifications.\\n\\nAccording to the commander, the Karrar drone was equipped with a Majid missile, which could explode several airborne targets with its warhead. The drone, on its part, has several feathers to its cap already that the Iranian military has made a point to highlight.\\n\\nKarrar is the first Iranian military drone and has surpassed the record for the highest service ceiling at 47,000 feet. The primary purpose of the contemporary Iranian jet drone Karrar is to intercept enemy aircraft. It’s also known as an advanced interceptor drone at times. It enables the country’s armed forces to execute a more excellent range of high-altitude air defense tasks.\\n\\nIran is testing UAVs with air-to-air missiles.

A blockade on Gaza has meant dwindling supplies of food, fuel, water and medicine, and U.N. and Arab leaders have called for a cease-fire to allow entry of humanitarian aid that is only trickling in.Gaza's Health Ministry on Thursday\\n\\nreleased a detailed list of names and identification numbers of those killed, including more than 3,000 minors and more than 1,500 women.More than 1,400 people were slain in Israel during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, according to the Israeli government, and at least 229 hostages were taken into Gaza. Palestinian militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel, including one that hit a residential building in Tel Aviv on Friday, wounding four people.\\n\\nThe overall number of deaths far exceeds the combined toll of all four previous wars between Israel and Hamas,\\n\\nestimated at around 4,000. A ground invasion is expected to cause even higher casualties on both sides as Israeli forces and Hamas battle each other in dense residential areas.\\n\\nHospitals have been scrounging for fuel to run emergency generators that power incubators and other life-saving equipment after Israel cut off all fuel deliveries to Gaza at the start of the war, forcing its only power plant to shut down. Gallant said Israel believes that Hamas would confiscate any fuel that enters. He said Hamas uses generators to pump air into its hundreds of kilometers (miles) of tunnels, which originate in civilian areas. He showed reporters aerial footage of what he said was a tunnel shaft built right next to a hospital.\\n\\n“For air, they need oil. For oil, they need us,” he said.\\n\\nLittle is known about Hamas' secretive tunnels and other infrastructure, and it wasn't possible to independently confirm Gallant's claims.\\n\\nLynne Hastings, the U.N. aid coordinator for the Palestinian territories, declined to comment on Gallant's remarks, saying “we don't know what Hamas has or doesn't have.”\\n\\n“We have been bringing fuel into Gaza in coordination with the government of Israel for decades. We know fuel is a high-risk item and are working with the Israelis to make sure what we will be using for our operations is done securely,” she said.\\n\\nThe U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which provides basic services to hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza, said it has been forced to ration fuel among lifesaving machines in hospitals, bakeries, and desalination plants, and only has enough for a few more days.\\n\\n“The siege means that food, water and fuel – basic commodities — are being used to collectively punish more than 2 million people, among them, a majority of children and women,” Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, told reporters.\\n\\nEarlier on Friday, the military said ground forces raided inside Gaza, striking dozens of militant targets over the past 24 hours. It said aircraft and artillery bombed targets in Shijaiyah, a neighborhood on Gaza City's outskirts that was the scene of\\n\\nan urban battle in the 2014 Gaza war. The military said the soldiers exited the territory without suffering any casualties. It reported an earlier, hourslong raid into northern Gaza on Thursday.\\n\\nThe damage to Gaza from nearly three weeks of bombardment showed\\n\\nin satellite photos of several locations taken before the war and again in recent days. Entire rows of residential buildings simply disappear in the photos, reduced to smears of dust and rubble. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and accuses Hamas of operating among civilians in an attempt to protect its fighters.\\n\\nThe conflict has threatened to ignite a wider war across the region.\\n\\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that the Friday strikes in eastern Syria were a response to “ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks” against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria over the past 10 days. He said the operation was separate from the Israel-Hamas war.\\n\\nHezbollah, an Iranian-backed ally of Hamas in Lebanon, has repeatedly traded fire with Israel along the border, and Israel has carried out airstrikes targeting Iran-linked groups in Syria. The United States has sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the region, along with additional weaponry and personnel, in part to deter Iran and its allies from entering the war.\\n\\nEgypt's military meanwhile said a drone crashed into a building in the Red Sea town of Taba, on the border with Israel, slightly wounding six people. In a separate incident, the state-run Al-Qahera news said a “strange object” landed near a power station in the Red Sea town of Nuweiba, further south. Footage showed debris and smoke rising from the side of a nearby mountain.\\n\\nLast week, a U.S. Navy destroyer in the northern Red Sea shot down\\n\\nthree cruise missiles and several drones launched toward Israel by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in northern Yemen.About 1.4 million of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have fled their homes, with nearly half of them crowding into U.N. shelters.\\n\\nHundreds of thousands remain in northern Gaza, despite Israel ordering them to evacuate to the south and saying that those who remain might be considered “accomplices” of Hamas.Over the past week, Israel has allowed more than 80 trucks with aid enter from Egypt through the Rafah crossing, the only entry point into Gaza not controlled by Israel. But aid workers say the convoys meet only a tiny fraction of the territory's mounting humanitarian needs.

Secretary-General António Guterres’ comment that the deadly Hamas attack on southern Israel “did not happen in a vacuum,” calling it justification for terrorism. Foreign Minister Eli Cohen cancelled a scheduled meeting with Guterres while Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial, said the U.N. chief “failed the test.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I will not meet with the UN secretary-general. After the October 7 massacre, there is no place for a balanced approach. Hamas must be erased off the face of the planet!” Cohen posted Tuesday on social platform X.\\n\\nIsrael’s envoy to the U.N. Gilad Erdan called for his resignation, saying Israel must rethink its relations with the world body.\\n\\n\\n\\n“We will refuse to grant visas to U.N. representatives. We have already refused to give one to Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths,” Erdan told Army Radio, accusing Guterres of justifying a slaughter. “It’s time to teach them a lesson.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIsrael historically has had tense relations with the U.N., accusing it of being biased against it. On Tuesday, Guterres addressed a special Security Council meeting on the Israel-Hamas war that was sparked by the militant group’s Oct.7 attack, which left at least 1,400 Israelis dead, and more than 220 taken hostage.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe U.N. chief told the council that he “condemned unequivocally the horrifying and unprecedented 7 October acts of terror by Hamas in Israel.” “Nothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnapping of civilians — or the launching of rockets against civilian targets,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut his contextualization of the attack created an uproar in Israel. It was important, Guterres said, to acknowledge that “the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Guterres tried to walk back the comments, tweeting: “The grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the horrific attacks by Hamas. Those horrendous attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.” But Israel was not mollified.\\n\\n\\n\\n“The slaughter of Jew by Hamas on October 7th was genocidal in its intents and immeasurably brutal in its form,” Yad Vashem Chairman Dani Dayan said in a statement. He said that it tests the sincerity of world leaders who came to Yad Vashem and pledged “Never Again.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Those who seek to ‘understand,’ look for a justifying context, do not condemn the perpetrators, and do not call for the unconditional and immediate release of the abducted – fail the test. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres failed the test.”',\n",

This \"targeted raid\" marks a crucial step in the escalating conflict between Israel and the Hamas terror group. It serves as preparation for the forthcoming full-scale ground offensive, which Israeli officials have vowed to execute, reported the Times Of israel.\\n\\nSeveral Hamas Sites Hit By IDF\\n\\nThe IDF\\'s operation, led by the Givati infantry brigade and the 162nd Armored Division, was focused on preparing the border area for the \"next stages of the war,\" which refers to the imminent full ground offensive. During the operation, Israeli troops struck numerous terrorists, targeted infrastructure, and disabled anti-tank-guided missile launch positions. The objective was to secure the battlefield for future ground operations.\\n\\nIDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari confirmed that the operation lasted a few hours and that no Israeli soldiers were harmed. He stated that the raid aimed to eliminate terrorists, neutralize threats, dismantle explosives, and neutralize ambushes to facilitate subsequent ground operations.\\n\\nThis ground incursion surpassed the near-daily \"localized raids\" that Israeli soldiers had been conducting along the border. These localized efforts primarily focused on searching for missing Israelis and clearing explosives left behind by Hamas terrorists since the October 7 attack. Israel has articulated its mission as destroying Hamas\\'s infrastructure and dismantling the organization following the October 7 attacks while minimizing harm to Gaza\\'s civilian population.\\n\\nIn preparation for the next stages of combat, the IDF operated in northern Gaza.\\n\\n\\n\\nIDF tanks & infantry struck numerous terrorist cells, infrastructure and anti-tank missile launch posts.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe soldiers have since exited the area and returned to Israeli territory. pic.twitter.com/oMdSDR84rU — Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) October 26, 2023\\n\\nRise In Rocket Attack From Hamas\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe recent conflict, led by Hamas and other terror groups, saw around 2,500 terrorists infiltrate Israel from the Gaza Strip, resulting in numerous casualties. Thousands of rockets were launched at Israeli towns and cities during this assault.\\n\\nGaza Evacuation\\n\\nThe IDF has been urging Palestinian residents to evacuate the northern Gaza area as it intensifies strikes in preparation for a major ground offensive. In the past day, Israeli jets targeted over 250 sites belonging to Hamas, including infrastructure, command centers, tunnels, and rocket launchers. Navy forces also struck a Hamas surface-to-air missile launch position situated near a mosque and kindergarten.\\n\\nRising Casualty\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that casualty figures are disputed, with Gaza\\'s Hamas-run health ministry reporting 6,546 deaths, mainly civilians, including many children. These figures are difficult to independently verify and are believed to include Hamas terrorists and gunmen killed in both Israel and Gaza.\\n\\nDelay In Gaza Ground Offensive\\n\\nThe full ground offensive into Gaza has experienced delays due to tactical and strategic considerations. Israel\\'s agreement to temporarily delay the operation was influenced by the United States, which sought additional time to deploy air defence systems and engage in internationally brokered negotiations with Hamas regarding the release of hostages. As Israel prepares for a ground offensive, troops will face the daunting task of navigating Gaza\\'s network of tunnels, booby traps, and urban combat.\\n\\nPM Confirms Gaza Ground Invasion\\n\\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the impending ground incursion while withholding specific details on timing and strategy, emphasizing the need to protect soldiers\\' lives and citing unanimous decision-making among officials. He stated that the offensive aims to destroy Hamas and secure the release of hostages, referring to members of the terror group as \"dead men walking.\"',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'UNITED NATIONS: The widespread use of American weapons by Israel, which has killed thousands of civilians in Gaza, has triggered accusations of war crimes against the United States.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the US has always escaped these charges in contemporary military conflicts –particularly in the killing fields of Afghanistan and Iraq –and also in the use of American weapons in Yemen where thousands have been killed.\\n\\nThe United Nations once described the deaths and destruction in the eight-year-old civil war in Yemen as “the world’s worst humanitarian disaster”.\\n\\nThe killings of mostly civilians have been estimated at over 100,000, with accusations of war crimes against a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), whose primary arms supplier is the US.\\n\\nAnd now, the killings of Palestinians in Gaza have come back to haunt the Americans in a new war zone. But still, the US is unlikely to be hauled before the International Criminal Court (ICC).\\n\\n“If U.S. officials don’t care about Palestinian civilians facing atrocities using U.S. weapons, perhaps they will care a bit more about their own individual criminal liability for aiding Israel in carrying out these atrocities,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), an American non-profit organization that advocates democracy and human rights in the Middle East.\\n\\n“The American people never signed up to help Israel commit war crimes against defenseless civilians with taxpayer funded bombs and artillery,” she noted.\\n\\nAccording to DAWN, U.S. law requires that the United States monitor and ensure that weapons and munitions it provides to Israel are not used to commit war crimes in Gaza.\\n\\nThe advocacy group reminded both Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III in a letter sent last week.\\n\\n“Failure to comply with end-use monitoring requirements not only breaches U.S. laws but also could expose U.S. officials to prosecution by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for aiding and abetting war crimes,” warned DAWN.\\n\\nIn a separate letter to ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan, DAWN asked the Prosecutor urgently to issue a public statement reminding the parties to the conflict of the ongoing investigation there and send an investigative team to the Gaza region of Palestine to document and investigate potential crimes under the Rome Statute.\\n\\nMouin Rabbani, Co-Editor, Jadaliyya, an independent ezine produced by the Arab Studies Institute, told IPS the United States is in violation of international law, as well as its own domestic legislation, by providing weapons to Israel in the full knowledge that these are being used for the express purpose of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.\\n\\n“I would go further and state that it is providing them to Israel for precisely this reason. This is because the US is determined to see Israel achieve its objectives in the Gaza Strip; Washington recognizes that Israel does not have the military capacity and political will to physically occupy the Gaza Strip for a prolonged period and eradicate Hamas and other groups, and has instead — with unqualified US support — adopted as its primary objective the systematic destruction of the Gaza Strip and mass killings of Palestinian civilians”, he pointed out.\\n\\nAs for international law and domestic US legislation, these are as irrelevant as Palestinian lives in this context. That’s how the US-designed rules-based international order works and was designed to work, he said.\\n\\n“US legislation, the laws of war, and international law more generally, are rigorously applied to rivals and adversaries, while the US and its partners are free to violate them with total impunity, Rabbani argued.\\n\\nIt would be fair to say that ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan is the personification of this system — fearlessly prosecuting official enemies and adversaries with rabid zeal, but more docile than a dead canary when similar or greater crimes are committed by states his government and its Western partners support without qualification, said Rabbani.\\n\\nIf there’s one thing US officials complicit in Israel’s war crimes don’t have to worry about, it is prosecution by the ICC, he declared.\\n\\nAsked about US weapons in killings in Gaza, Matthew Miller, Spokesperson for the State Department told reporters last week that American weapons cannot be deliberately used against civilians.\\n\\n“Of course – and one of the tragedies of war –is that there are always civilian deaths. It is one of the great tragedies of war, and what we try to do is work to minimize civilian deaths to the greatest extent possible,” he said.\\n\\nAsked if there is “any concern among the administration that by supplying this military assistance, the US might be involved in any possible war crimes against civilians”, Miller said: “No, I would say that we have made very clear that we expect Israel to conduct its operations in compliance with international law.”\\n\\n“That is the standard we hold – uphold – that’s the standard we hold ourselves to; it’s the standard we hold our partners to; it’s the standard every democracy ought to be held to. And we will continue to work with them and continue to deliver messages to them that they should conduct their military operations in – and to the maximum extent possible to protect civilians from harm,” he declared.\\n\\nAccording to the Washington-based Stimson Center, Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. military assistance since the Second World War, amounting to more than $158 billion over the past seven decades– not adjusted for inflation.\\n\\nIn recent years, U.S. assistance to Israel has been outlined in a 10-year memoranda of understandings, the most recent of which was signed in 2016 and pledges $38 billion in military assistance between FY2019-FY2028.\\n\\nDr Ramzy Baroud, Palestinian journalist and author, told IPS asking the US to clarify the End Use Monitoring (EUM) measures, or Israel’s compliance with the use of American weapons in its war against Gaza, may give the impression that Washington lacks awareness of how US weapons, and US tax payers money are being used.\\n\\n“Never before in the history of the US’s relationship with the Middle East has Washington been so directly involved in an Israeli war. The closest was the 1973 war, and even then, the US involvement arrived a week later, and was hardly as direct,” he said.\\n\\nEvery statement made by top US officials, starting with Biden, to Blinken to Sullivan, to all others, indicate that the US is a party in the war, not an outsider, a benefactor, and certainly not a mediator. They even sat in on meetings to discuss Israeli war plans on Gaza. They cannot claim ignorance, Dr, Baroud pointed out.\\n\\n“In the past, Israel has violated the US’s rules on the use of US arms against civilians, and repeatedly so. Much has been written about this subject, particularly in terms of Israeli violation of the Lehy Laws.”\\n\\nBut what is happening right now is a whole different reality. By sending massive arm shipments, aircraft carriers, and even soldiers to Israel, the US has become a party in the world, therefore it is responsible for the unprecedented war crimes in Gaza, he argued.\\n\\n“The fingerprints of US weapons are on the body of every Palestinian killed in Gaza, from the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, to UN schools, to every house and every street.\\n\\nWe don’t demand clarification regarding the use of these weapons. We know precisely how they are being used. We demand accountability from war criminals, whether in Tel Aviv or Washington,” he noted.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a report on Cable News Network (CNN) October 22 said the death toll in Gaza since October 7 has risen to 4,651, with more than 14,245 wounded, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.\\n\\nInter Press Service',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'MUMBAI : At the recently concluded International Monetary Fund (IMF)-World Bank meetings in Marrakesh, officials fretted over the new trend of interest rates remaining high for a long period. Mint looks at how it will impact the world at large and India in particular.\\n\\nView Full Image Graphic: Mint\\n\\nWhat is the ‘higher-for-longer’ regime?\\n\\nCentral banks across the world have raised interest rates over the last 18 months or more to battle runaway inflation. The increase was more than 500 basis points (bps) in advanced economies and in excess of 650 bps in emerging markets. However, the battle against inflation is far from over. Core inflation in the US and many parts of Europe continues to remain high. The IMF, in its latest World Economic Outlook, does not expect inflation to return to within target levels until 2025 in most economies. This will necessitate keeping interest rates higher for a longer period of time.\\n\\nWhy is this trend worrying?\\n\\nExperts feel the global economy, which is just emerging from the pandemic, may not be prepared to handle high interest rates. Most countries have piled up huge debts and lower income countries are particularly stressed. The banking system is under pressure with many US banks needing a bailout. The higher cost of borrowings will hurt the beleaguered property sector further. Household savings across the world are dropping and delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans are on the rise in some markets. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva has warned of a multidimensional threat to stability.\\n\\nWhat does the end to free money mean?\\n\\nBefore March 2022, when the US Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates, the borrowing cost was almost zero. Many countries kept rates at that level to fuel economic growth. Experts say the policy led to tepid growth and low productivity. While higher interest rates will slow growth, they feel it will lead to a fairer and more productive world economy.\\n\\nHow will this impact the world economy?\\n\\nIt is slowing down the world’s economy. The IMF pegs global economic growth at 3% for 2023 as against 3.5% in 2022. As the full effect of the tightening monetary policy and higher interest rates kicks in, it expects growth to slow to 2.9% in 2024. This is much lower than the 3.8% average economic growth between 2000 and 2019. In fact, the medium-term growth forecast of 3.1% is the lowest in decades. Rising geopolitical flare-ups, the latest being the Israel-Palestine conflict, adds more risk to global growth.\\n\\nWhat impact will it have on India?\\n\\nDespite the overall gloom, the IMF recently revised India’s FY24 growth upward to 6.3% making it the fastest growing large economy. But the ‘higher-for-longer’ interest rate scenario has the potential to disrupt this growth. It is already increasing the bond yields in the US. This could trigger a portfolio outflow from India. If that happens, the rupee will slide. A weaker rupee will make imports costly, driving up inflation. This could force the Reserve Bank of India to raise interest rates and that could slow down growth.',\n",

However, global factors, including interest rates trajectory in the US and geopolitical tension will remain critical factors for the domestic market.\\n\\nExperts expect volatility to remain high in the current holiday-shortened week due to the prevailing earnings season and the scheduled expiry of October derivatives contracts.\\n\\nOn the technical front, Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President of technical research at Religare Broking pointed out that the Nifty has been hovering in the range of 19,300-19,850 for almost a month now and inching lower after retesting the upper band.\\n\\n\"We feel fresh weakness in the banking majors combined with the resumption of decline on the global front could push the index lower and 19,200-19,450 would continue to act as a crucial support zone,\" Mishra said.\\n\\n\"Resilience in select heavyweights from auto, FMCG, pharma and realty majors would continue to offer buying opportunities. Traders should align their positions accordingly and prefer hedged trades,\" said Mishra.\\n\\nConsidering the prevailing headwinds in the market, experts advise following a stock-specific approach at the current juncture.\\n\\nBased on the recommendations of several experts, below are nine stocks that one can consider buying for the next three to four weeks.

       " {'articleBody': 'The delegation of the Palestinian military group was led by Moussa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, who met with Mikhail Bogdanov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, Hamas said in a statement.\\n\\nThe two sides have discussed the release of foreign hostages from the Gaza Strip, the Russian foreign ministry said, according to RIA Novosti, a Russian state news agency. They also discussed the evacuation of Russians and other foreigners from the region. In its statement, Hamas praised Mr. Putin’s position on the conflict and the active efforts of Russian diplomacy.\\n\\nSince Hamas’s terrorist attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, Russia has kept a conspicuous distance from the conflict. Days after, in his first comments about the war, Mr. Putin called it “a clear example of the United States’ failed policy in the Middle East.”\\n\\nIn subsequent comments, Mr. Putin continued to accuse the United States of monopolizing the efforts to resolve the conflict and of neglecting the fundamental political issues that are preventing its resolution. He also called for an immediate cease-fire and the resumption of talks in the framework of the U.N.-approved two-state solution to the conflict.\\n\\nBut as the United States engaged in an intense flurry of talks with regional powers, presenting itself as the main power broker in the Middle East, Russia risked its assumed role as one of the major international powers with enough clout to be relevant in all major crises.\\n\\nRecently, Russia has been trying to catch up. Last week, Mr. Putin called all major leaders in the region, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. Mr. Bogdanov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, met with Hamas leadership in Qatar this week, according to Tass, the Russian state news agency. The meetings in Moscow on Thursday built on these efforts.\\n\\nAlexandra Appelberg, an editor with the Detaly news outlet in Israel, said that “Russia is trying to demonstrate that the West’s plan to isolate it following the invasion of Ukraine has failed and that it plays an important role.”\\n\\nAccording to Ms. Appelberg, Russia has “practically no real levers” that can allow Moscow to influence the situation, but that it might want to “raise its prestige in the Arab world.”\\n\\nRussia has historically capitalized on its ability to speak to all major parties in the ongoing conflict. One year after Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, Mr. Putin met with Khaled Meshaal, then the group’s leader, in Moscow. Despite its own traumatic history with terrorism, Russia has never designated Hamas as a terrorist group.\\n\\nDuring a meeting with Russian religious leaders in the Kremlin on Wednesday, Mr. Putin offered his condolences to Israeli citizens and said that Russia “knows firsthand what international terrorism is all about.”\\n\\nBut he also criticized Israel, saying that “the fight against terrorism cannot be conducted on the notorious principle of collective responsibility resulting in the deaths of the elderly, women, children, entire families.”\\n\\nMr. Bogdanov also met with his Iranian counterpart, Ali Bagheri Kani, on Thursday. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said that the two sides acknowledged the need “to stop armed hostilities in the Gaza Strip and around it.”\\n\\nAaron Boxerman contributed reporting.',\n",

Photo: Violeta Santos Moura/Reuters\\n\\nAid proposals fail in UN security council votes\\n\\nAt the United Nations, Russia and China vetoed a US-drafted Security Council resolution calling for pauses in hostilities to allow much needed food, water and medicine to be delivered to Palestinian civilians. The United Arab Emirates also voted no, while 10 members voted in favour and two abstained.\\n\\nRussia made a rival proposal that advocated a wider ceasefire, but failed to win the minimum number of votes. Israel has resisted both, arguing that Hamas would only take advantage and create new threats to Gaza civilians. Limited deliveries of food, medicine and water from Egypt restarted on Saturday through Rafah, the only crossing not controlled by Israel.\\n\\nTrucks carrying aid arrive at the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt, as the conflict between Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas continues, in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. Photo: Reuters\\n\\nInvasion preparations\\n\\nIsrael has vowed to wipe out Hamas, which rules Gaza. \"We will keep striking in Gaza in order to achieve the goals of the war,\" Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said. \"Every strike strengthens us and improves our situation ahead of the next stages in the war.\"\\n\\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised statement that Israel was \"preparing for a ground invasion. I will not elaborate on when, how or how many.\"\\n\\nIsraeli tanks and troops are massed on the border with Gaza awaiting orders. Israel has called up 360,000 reservists. International pressure is growing to delay any invasion of Gaza, not least because of hostages. More than half the estimated 220 hostages held by Hamas have foreign passports from 25 different countries, the Israeli government said. Many were believed to have had dual Israeli nationality.\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing US and Israeli officials, reported that Israel had agreed to delay invading Gaza for now so that the United States could rush missile defences to the region to protect US forces there, reflecting its concern the Gaza war may spread to other parts of the Middle East. US officials have so far persuaded Israel to hold off until US air defence systems can be placed in the region, as early as this week, the Journal said.\\n\\nAsked about the report, US officials told Reuters that Washington had raised its concerns with Israel that Iran and Iranian-backed Islamist groups could escalate the conflict by attacking US troops in the Middle East. An Israeli incursion into Gaza could be a trigger for Iranian proxies, they said.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': \"Home\\n\\nViews On News\\n\\nOct 25, 2023 - Top 5 Undervalued Smallcap Stocks to Watch Out for in 2024\\n\\nTop 5 Undervalued Smallcap Stocks to Watch Out for in 2024\\n\\nThe mainstream media all over is talking about yesterday's market correction.\\n\\nThe benchmarks BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty saw a fall of over 1.3%, enough to get investors and traders panicking.\\n\\nBroader markets were hammered to an even greater extent. Look at the chart of the BSE smallcap index in yesterday's trade.\\n\\nTo put things into context, the Indian share market has been falling for the past four sessions now. Some investors have already started to wonder whether we're entering a bear market.\\n\\nWhen emotions run high, it's very hard to hold on to your investments. The general instinct is panic selling.\\n\\nAnd that's when investors get so lost and confused that they forget to analyse the fundamental reasons behind the correction.\\n\\nCurrently, the Indian share market is falling due to rising US bond yields, uncertainty over the Israel-Hamas conflict and a resultant fall in global markets.\\n\\nWe at Equitymaster believe these are normal up and down moves of the market. The really serious declines begin only when the benchmark index falls at least 10%. That's not happened as yet!\\n\\nAnd even if something like that does happen, such correction would create good buying opportunities in fundamentally strong stocks for the long term.\\n\\nThat brings us to smallcaps.\\n\\nYou see, smaller companies have greater growth opportunities compared to their larger counterparts. That's what makes them compelling enough over largecap or bluechip stocks.\\n\\nFor example, Reliance adding a couple of billion rupees to its bottom-line by launching a new product would barely move its stock price.\\n\\nBut a small-cap stock announcing its foray into emerging fields or getting a new drug approval is enough to make a serious impact in its stock price overnight.\\n\\nIt's not all rainbows for smallcaps either. Smallcap stocks are impacted more than their large counterparts during market drawdowns. But the silver lining is that during the rebound, they bounce back stronger.\\n\\nKeeping that in mind and the current correction in smallcaps, let's look at the top 5 undervalued smallcap stocks that could possibly do well in 2024.\\n\\nThese companies are filtered using Equitymaster's powerful stock screener.\\n\\n#1 VLS Finance\\n\\nFirst on this list is VLS Finance.\\n\\nEstablished in 1986, VLS Finance is a multi-faceted, multi-divisional, integrated financial services group.\\n\\nIt provides various services like asset management, strategic private equity investments, arbitrage, and investment banking.\\n\\nWhat factors make VLS Finance undervalued at the current valuations?\\n\\nAt the current price, the stock trades at a single-digit price to earnings (PE) multiple of 3.4x. This compares with its long term 5-year average PE of 4.1x.\\n\\nEven if we compare it on a price to book value basis, the stock trades at a P/BV multiple of 0.27x. It's like getting a 100 rupee note at Rs 27.\\n\\nVLS Finance is a debt free company, able to generate positive net cash flow.\\n\\nAlthough its financial performance was impacted in FY23, the company is hopeful of improving margins in the coming quarters.\\n\\nIt also pays consistent dividends and has averaged a dividend yield of over 1% for the last seven years.\\n\\nPromoters of the company continue to remain bullish as they keep buying shares from the open market. The shareholding data shows that promoters have taken their stake up constantly for the past two quarters.\\n\\nThey even bought back shares at Rs 200 earlier this year in January 2023.\\n\\nGiven the stark difference in its actual book value and the current market price, the stock could bounce back in the coming months, depending on the performance it puts out for FY24.\\n\\n#2 Sandesh\\n\\nNext on this list is Sandesh.\\n\\nEstablished in 1923, Sandesh is one of Gujarat's largest and most influential media houses.\\n\\nThe company initially started off as a Gujarati daily newspaper. It has subsequently forayed into various other branches of the media and entertainment industry including television channels, magazines, OOH, and digital media.\\n\\nComing to its valuations...\\n\\nThe stock currently trades at a PE multiple of 6.4x. This compares with its 5-year average PE of 6.8x.\\n\\nOn the book value front, it trades at a P/BV multiple of 0.7x compared to its 5-year average of 0.6x.\\n\\nIn the financial year 2023, the company reported healthy growth in topline as well as bottomline owing to growth in its advertisement segment.\\n\\nSince the coming year is an election year, experts are of the view that the company's revenue could shoot up even more and the advertisement revenue could particularly get a boost.\\n\\nYou see, the media industry plays a crucial role in an election year as political parties interact with voters using print media, television, radio, etc. This translates into revenue growth for the media industry.\\n\\nSandesh, with its strong brand and established presence in Gujarat, could be one of the biggest beneficiaries.\\n\\nCurrently, the company has zero debt on its books and it has maintained a healthy liquidity position. The company's profits also show an increasing trend.\\n\\nThis could continue in the medium term and stock could possibly catch up to its book value.\\n\\n#3 Gujarat State Fertilizers\\n\\nThird on this list is Gujarat State Fertilizers.\\n\\nGujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals (GSFC), a government entity, manufactures various fertilizers and industrial products like plastics & synthetic rubbers and man-made fibres.\\n\\nThe company's integrated manufacturing facilities enable it to benefit from synergies.\\n\\nFertilizers contribute around 70% to the company's operating income whereas industrial products contribute the balance.\\n\\nThe stock currently trades at a PE multiple of 7.4x. This compares with its 5-year average PE of 7.7x.\\n\\nOn the book value front, it trades at a P/BV multiple of 0.7x compared to its 5-year average of 0.5x.\\n\\nShares of the company got a boost in the past one month after the Israel-Hamas war impacted fertilizer prices, making GSFC a prime beneficiary of this trend.\\n\\nThe geopolitical conflict has raised concerns regarding the global supply chain of potash fertilizer.\\n\\nAshdod Port, which is a significant hub for Israel's potash fertilizer exports located north of Gaza, is now operating in an emergency mode due to the conflict. This situation might place around 3% of the global potash supply at risk.\\n\\nWhat makes GSFC compelling apart from valuations is that its fertilizer segment has started to show improvement for the past couple of quarters.\\n\\nThe company also has a long history of paying dividends. In FY23, GSFC declared a one-time special dividend of 6.3%. This was significantly higher than the company's average dividend yield of 2.1% over the past 5 years.\\n\\nIt's also planning a massive capex for the next four years, around Rs 28 bn. This should keep the company in healthy stead going forward.\\n\\n#4 HUDCO\\n\\nFourth on this list is HUDCO.\\n\\nHousing & Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) is a public limited company (Government of India undertaking).\\n\\nBeing majorly owned by the centre, the company receives support in terms of board representation and access to low-cost funds.\\n\\nThe company is primarily engaged in the business of financing housing and urban development activities in the country.\\n\\nOver the years, HUDCO has played a significant role in the implementation of its various initiatives in urban infrastructure and social housing projects.\\n\\nComing to valuations, the stock currently trades at a PE multiple of 8.4x. This compares with its 5-year average PE of 5.3x.\\n\\nOn the book value front, it trades at a P/BV multiple of 0.9x compared to its 5-year average of 0.7x.\\n\\nWhile this may seem like an overvaluation, a fundamentally strong stock available at single digit PE multiple and below 1x its book value might make the case.\\n\\nThe valuations have shot up a bit in recent months after the company announced fundraising plans this year. In March 2023, HUDCO's board announced plans to raise Rs 180 bn as part of its fundraising exercise.\\n\\nThe company is in the process of seeking fresh registration under the RBI as a housing finance company.\\n\\nIt also rewards shareholders consistently by making large dividend payouts. HUDCO boasts of a high dividend yield of 5.2% on its current market price.\\n\\nGiven the company's rising exposure to urban infrastructure, in line with the government's increased focus towards infrastructure development, it might set the stage for HUDCO, which sanctions loans under various infrastructure schemes.\\n\\nGovernment holding in HUDCO stands at over 81% as on 30 June 2023.\\n\\n#5 Ambika Cotton\\n\\nLast on this list is Ambika Cotton.\\n\\nThe company manufactures premium quality compact and elitwist cotton yarn used in hosiery and weaving.\\n\\nIt is an established textile player in the international and domestic yarn market, with exports constituting over 60% of its revenues.\\n\\nThe stock currently trades at a PE multiple of 9.3x. This compares with its 5-year average PE of 8.8x.\\n\\nOn the book value front, it trades at a P/BV multiple of 1.1x compared to its 5-year average of 1.2x.\\n\\nThe undervaluation could be due to the fact that the Indian cotton textile industry has faced multiple challenges in the past one year. The high price volatility and the higher absolute raw materials prices have dented the margins.\\n\\nThe relative price differences compared to the international markets have led to a massive competitive disadvantage for most Indian textile players.\\n\\nApart from this, a demand slowdown due to geopolitical tensions and inflation in European and US economies has dented the profitability further.\\n\\nThe company also posted a decline in revenue for the first quarter of FY24 while operating margins declined mainly on account of higher inventory cost and increase in employee expenses.\\n\\nGiven its established market position and relatively strong balance sheet with zero debt, the company could possibly tide over this subdued phase.\\n\\nThe company also pays consistent and higher dividend every year.\\n\\nGoing forward, Ambika Cottom is well-poised to benefit from the growth in the textile segment, which comes from rising disposable income in the country and the low cost advantage in terms of skilled manpower.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIt's said price is what you pay and value is what you get.\\n\\nGoing by this simple principle, one of the greatest investors of all time Warren Buffett has been able to beat the market for decades running.\\n\\nMany companies fall out of favour due to whatsoever reasons, be it unexpected losses or growth in the business slowing down.\\n\\nBut once the business gets up and running and investors come back to their senses, the share price of these undervalued companies shoots back up to its intrinsic value.\\n\\nThe companies mentioned above are strong contenders to bounce back in the medium term.\\n\\nTo conclude, stay invested, wait for the recovery, and be greedy when others are fearful (that means right now.)\\n\\nHappy Investing!\\n\\nInvestment in securities market are subject to market risks.

The resolution was not adopted because permanent council members Russia and China cast vetoes.\\n\\nThe Russian resolution , which was then put to a vote, would have called for an immediate “humanitarian cease-fire” and unequivocally condemned Hamas’ October 7 attacks in Israel and “indiscriminate attacks” on civilians and civilian objects in Gaza.\\n\\nIn that vote, four countries voted in favour – Russia, China, United Arab Emirates and Gabon. The United States and the United Kingdom voted against it, and nine countries abstained. The resolution wasn’t adopted because it failed to get the minimum nine “yes” votes.\\n\\nThe failure of the two resolutions followed the council’s rejections last week of a Russian resolution that didn’t mention Hamas and also failed to get nine “yes” votes and a widely supported Brazilian resolution vetoed by the United States that would have condemned the Hamas attacks and all violence against civilians and called for “humanitarian pauses.”\\n\\nAfter the votes, Malta’s U.N. Ambassador Vanessa Frazier, speaking on behalf of the 10 elected members of the council serving two-year terms, announced they will be working on a new proposal in the coming days.\\n\\n“As elected members of this council, we also represent the rest of the international community and we have a duty and an obligation to act,” she told the council. “There is no time to waste.”\\n\\nBefore the vote, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the council that last week she had said diplomacy needed to play out before it approved a resolution. She pointed to action by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, President Joe Biden, and regional leaders that led to the opening of the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza to the delivery of some desperately needed humanitarian aid, though “much, much more help is needed” as well as the release of four of the more than 200 hostages taken from Israel.\\n\\nThomas-Greenfield called this moment a test for the international community and for the council. She accused Russia of introducing a resolution at the last minute “in bad faith” with no consultations and urged members to vote for the “strong and balanced” U.S. text.\\n\\nRussia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia countered that an immediate humanitarian cease-fire is needed to de-escalate the conflict and reduce the bloodshed and “shocking” Palestinian casualties. He called the U.S. draft “politicised” and claimed the United States doesn’t want the Security Council to have any influence on a possible Israeli ground offensive that “would risk provoking an even larger-scale conflict in the region and possibly even beyond.”\\n\\nAfter the vote, China’s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said the U.S. draft contained many elements that went beyond humanitarian needs and were “deeply divisive.” He called it “evasive on the most urgent issue of ending the fighting” and said it failed to reflect the world’s strong calls for a cease-fire.\\n\\nUnited Arab Emirates Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh, the Arab representative on the council who voted against the U.S. resolution and for the Russian draft, said the U.N. and humanitarian organisations have made clear that what is essential is a humanitarian cease-fire, the release of all hostages, and sustained humanitarian access to Gaza.\\n\\nAt a council meeting on the war Tuesday that heard nearly 90 speakers, there were “dozens of statements imploring this council to assign the same value to Palestinian life as it does to Israeli life,” Nusseibeh said. “We cannot allow any equivocation on this point.”\\n\\nIsrael’s U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan thanked the U.S. and other nations that supported its resolution for condemning “savage genocidal terrorists while standing up for the values of freedom and security.”\\n\\nThose who voted against the resolution showed the world the Security Council is incapable of condemning “terrorists and cannot confirm the right to self-defence of the victim of these heinous crimes.”\\n\\nRiyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, told the Associated Press after the vote “It’s disgusting the Security Council is not shouldering its responsibility” to “ stop the war .\"\\n\\n“You do not start by killing the people and then say that I want to deal with the situation,” he said. “We need to save lives. … That is the most urgent priority.”\\n\\nWith the Security Council still paralysed, the Palestinians are turning to the 193-member General Assembly where there are no vetoes — just as Ukraine did after Russia\\'s February 2022 invasion. The assembly\\'s emergency special session opens Thursday, with 106 speakers on the list, and Arab nations have circulated a draft resolution which Mansour said he expects to be put to a vote on Friday afternoon.\\n\\nThe draft resolution calls for an immediate cease-fire, demands that Israel rescind its order for Gazans to move from the north to the south, calls for maximum restraint, and demands that essential goods including food, water and medicine are provided in the Gaza Strip.',\n",

During the Apple keynote for the new iPhone 15s and the new Apple Watches, the company showcased a unique feature for Watch users. The double tap gesture is something you'd expect from a sci-fi movie but not from an existing gadget. Apple is rolling out this feature as part of the watchOS 10.1 and is set to change the way users interact with their Apple Watch.\\n\\nImagine this: You're walking your dog in the park, leash in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other. Your Apple Watch buzzes with an incoming call. Instead of juggling your coffee and leash to swipe an answer, you simply tap your index finger and thumb together twice. Voila! You've answered the call without missing a beat or spilling a drop.\\n\\nThis is just one of the many scenarios where the double tap gesture can come in handy. From scrolling through widgets in the Smart Stack, to controlling music playback, to even snapping an iPhone photo with the Camera Remote in the Camera app, this new feature is designed to make your Apple Watch experience more seamless and intuitive.\\n\\nThe magic behind this feature lies in the S9 SiP and the new 4-core Neural Engine. These chipsets process data from various sensors and use a machine learning algorithm to detect the unique signature of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when you perform a double tap.\\n\\nThe double-tap gesture is customizable too. You can choose to advance through widgets in the Smart Stack or select the first available widget; or decide between playing or pausing media during an active session, or skipping to the next track instead.\\n\\nThe double tap gesture is available starting today on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 running watchOS 10.1.

Col. Richard Hecht, Hamas has begun activating its long-range rockets, as seen in salvos fired in recent days at Haifa in the north and Eilat in the south, as well as rocket fire on central Israel on Thursday.\\n\\nBut Hecht said on Thursday that “they started using their long-range capabilities.”\\n\\nThe Israeli Air Force killed the Deputy Head of Hamas’s Intelligence Directorate, who was responsible for planning the Oct. 7 massacre in southern Israel together with Yahya Sinwar, the IDF announced on Thursday, naming the target as Shadi Barud.\\n\\n“In his previous role as the Head of the Fire Control Center in Hamas’s Operations Unit, Barud planned the barbaric October 7th attacks together with Yahya Sinwar. Barud had previously served as Hamas’s battalion commander in Khan Yunis and was responsible for planning numerous terror attacks against Israeli civilians,” the IDF said in a statement.\\n\\n“Following this, Barud held several positions in Hamas’s military intelligence and was responsible for information security. Until today, he was responsible for intelligence relations for Hamas,” it added.\\n\\nIsraeli Air Force fighter jets, based on IDF and ISA intelligence, also killed the Commander of Hamas’s Northern Khan Yunis Rockets Array, Hassan Al-Abdullah, according to the IDF.\\n\\nLater on Sunday, the IDF said that jets struck three senior Hamas operatives from the organization’s Daraj Tuffah Battalion. The terrorists had participated in previous attacks against Israel.\\n\\nIt named them as Battalion Commander Rifat Abbas; Battalion Deputy Commander Ibrahim Jadba; and Combat Support Commander Tarek Maarouf.\\n\\n“The Daraj Tuffah Battalion is a battalion in Hamas’s Gaza City Brigade, which is considered the most significant brigade of the Hamas terrorist organization. The battalion’s operatives played a significant role in the invasion and murderous attack against Israel on October 7,” the military stated.\\n\\n‘Slowly, we are taking out brigade, battalion commanders’\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the commander of Hamas’s Khan Younis Battalion, Taysir Mubasher, a former head of the Hamas naval force, was also killed. Mubasher had planned large-scale terror attacks against Israel and was the main Hamas commander in the Khan Yunis sector, according to the IDF.\\n\\n“Slowly, we’re taking out Hamas brigade and battalion commanders,” Hecht said on Sunday.\\n\\n“IAF fighter jets are continuing to strike Hamas terror infrastructure in the Gaza Strip, including military command centers and rocket launch posts,” he added.\\n\\nHecht also provided further details on the early-morning IDF-targeted raid in Gaza on Wednesday, describing it as “brigade-level,” adding that it consisted of infantry, tanks and D9 armored bulldozers in northern Gaza, around the border perimeter. “It was preparing the ground for future stages,” said Hecht, adding that an anti-tank missile was fired at the force; No casualties were reported. Future such raids are likely, Hecht added.\\n\\nThe IAF is continuously taking out terror tunnels, headquarters, weapons warehouses, mortar launchers and anti-tank missile squads, he said.\\n\\n“We are still emphasizing to the [Gazan] people to move south to the humanitarian area in southern Gaza,” Hecht said. “We see fuel in Gaza. Hamas can choose if they use this for hospitals or for their tunnel system.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Defense Ministry announced that its Directorate of Borders and the IDF’s Technological and Logistics Directorate completed, under fire, the repair and return to service of the sites that were damaged in the area around \\u200b\\u200bthe security fence.\\n\\n“As part of the joint effort known as ‘Returning Eyes to Gaza,’ the sites were searched and cleared of explosive devices alongside the installation of new systems in the area. The operations on the collection and cyber capabilities are almost fully completed,” said the ministry.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the north, an Israeli unmanned aerial vehicle struck a terror cell attempting to launch anti-tank missiles from Lebanon at an IDF post on Thursday.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, a surface-to-air missile fired from Lebanon towards an Israeli UAV was intercepted by an Israeli air-defense system, and the IAF struck the source of the launch.\\n\\nAs of Thursday evening, the IDF has counted 309 fallen soldiers, 224 confirmed hostages and 100 missing people.\\n\\nSubscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate by email and never miss our top stories Your Email Free sign up By signing up, you agree to receive emails from JNS and our advertising partners\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT',\n",

He is revered in his native Gaza for telling people's stories of suffering and hardship to the outside world.\\n\\nAccording to Al Jazeera, Dahdouh's family members were killed by an Israeli airstrike that hit Nuseirat Refugee Camp, located in an area of Gaza where the military had encouraged people to go to stay safe. It said a number of other relatives were still missing, and it remained unclear how many others were killed.\\n\\nDahdouh's family were among the more than 1 million Gaza residents displaced by the war, now in its 19th day, and were staying in a house in Nuseirat when the strike hit, the network said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe Israeli strikes have killed more than 6,500 Palestinians, Gaza's Health Ministry says.

It says it strikes only Hamas military targets, but the Palestinians say thousands of civilians have died. Israel accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIsrael has threatened to shut down Al Jazeera over its coverage of the war.

Also, Yadav’s son Tejashwi Prasad is financing it and the money has been already given out to kick start the work.

The post said the IDF had come under heavy fire since entering the city. There were no reports of casualties.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, the IDF and Shin Bet, Israel\\'s version of the FBI, reported more than 60 people were arrested in another raid that took place in the West Bank. According to i24 News, 46 were believed to be Hamas operatives.\\n\\nAccording to a joint statement from the IDF and Shin Bet, weapons, including two M-16 rifles, and incendiary materials were confiscated during the raid in the city of Tubasm, as well as in the village of Ein a-Shariat, in the Binyamin division.\\n\\nOverall, about 1,000 people have been arrested across the West Bank since Hamas\\' terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, including 660 associated with Hamas, the statement said. On Wednesday, the IDF reported the arrests of 68 people, 58 of whom have suspected ties to Hamas.\\n\\nSince Hamas\\' terrorist attack that killed more than 1,400 Israelis, the IDF has retaliated through an unprecedented aerial bombardment on the Gaza Strip. On Thursday, the IDF said airstrikes killed five senior Hamas commanders including Shadi Barud, the deputy head of Hamas\\' intelligence force, The Times of Israel reported. The IDF accused Barud of planning the Oct. 7 massacre along with Hamas\\' leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar.\\n\\nAnother strike killed Hassan al-Abdullah, head of Hamas\\' North Khan Younis rocket array, The Times of Israel reported, adding the IDF said fighter jets struck and killed several more Hamas members and destroyed several sites belonging to the terror group throughout the day.\\n\\nThe IDF has been preparing for a full-scale ground invasion into Gaza to root out Hamas terrorists and rescue hostages taken during the terror attack. Earlier Thursday, the IDF made a limited ground incursion into Gaza, sending infantry forces and tanks up to 3 miles into the northern part of the Strip in a \"targeted raid,\" The Times of Israel reported.\\n\\nThe raid, led by the Givati infantry brigade and the 162nd Armored Division, helped to prepare the area for the next stages of the war.

       " {'articleBody': 'The morning after U.S. House of Representatives Republicans united around new Speaker Mike Johnson, lawmakers on Thursday returned their attention to spending bills urgently needed to avert a government shutdown and respond to crises overseas.\\n\\nCongress has just over three weeks until a stopgap measure to keep federal agencies funded runs out on Nov. 17, and Democratic President Joe Biden is also pushing for $106 billion in new spending to aid Israel and Ukraine, and beef up enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border. Meanwhile, House Republicans are pushing for a full plate of 12 separate funding bills to keep agencies running until Sept. 30, 2024, the end of the fiscal year. This rare feat requires close negotiation between the narrowly Republican-controlled House and the Senate, which has a two-vote Democratic majority.\\n\\n\"We are going to deliver an aggressive schedule in the days and weeks ahead,\" Johnson told reporters on Wednesday, shortly after he was sworn in as speaker. Fights over money have occupied most of Congress\\' time for the past year. Partisan disputes brought the federal government to the brink of defaulting on its then-$31.4 trillion in debt in May, an event that would have shaken the world financial system.\\n\\nLess than a month ago, intra-party fighting among Republicans brought the federal government within hours of a partial shutdown, with hardline Republicans rejecting a $1.59 trillion discretionary spending limit Biden and Johnson\\'s predecessor Kevin McCarthy had agreed on, instead calling for an additional $120 billion in cuts. Since then, high interest rates have pushed up the government\\'s cost of borrowing and for the federal Social Security and Medicare programs, driving Washington to a $1.7 trillion deficit for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30.\\n\\nEven the simplest steps - like arriving at the duration of a short-term funding measure known as a \"continuing resolution\" that lawmakers agree will be needed to avoid a shutdown next month - were complicated by this month\\'s vacant speakership. \"It\\'s something we have to negotiate with the House and that\\'s difficult at the moment,\" Republican Senator John Kennedy, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, noted the day before Johnson\\'s election.\\n\\nSENATE PROGRESS The Senate, following long delays imposed by a few Republicans, is moving ahead with three of its 12 bipartisan funding bills. By next week it hopes to pass appropriations for farm programs, transportation and housing and veterans.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wants to then pivot to considering the aid money for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan - and the stop-gap funding. But the fiscal warfare between the Senate and conservative House Republicans that has raged since January is unlikely to end soon.\\n\\n\"Bipartisanship will be essential for keeping the government open in less than a month and bipartisanship will be essential for passing the president\\'s national security request,\" Schumer said in a Senate speech. Significant changes by Congress to Biden\\'s request for aid to Ukraine and more money for border security were anticipated.\\n\\nRepublican Representative Tom Cole, a powerful lawmaker who heads the gatekeeping committee for House legislation, said that \"wedge\" issues - partisan priorities - would slow the emergency spending package the White House is seeking. \"We need to be able to respond quickly and decisively in the kind of times we live in right now,\" Cole said. Asked what his advice to Johnson would be, he added, \"don\\'t overplay your hand.\"\\n\\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Nanette Diaz Barragan said in an interview that she does not believe money targeted to cities is enough to provide shelter and other services for immigrants being transported from the southwest border with Mexico to northern destinations. Republicans attack Biden\\'s border security spending, saying it falls far short in shutting down illegal border crossings and the flow of drugs such as fentanyl.\\n\\nAnd far-right conservatives could demand deep cuts in the stop-gap bill, instead of simply extending current spending levels. Senate appropriators from the two parties had varying expectations.\\n\\nDemocratic Senator Joe Manchin stressed the need for beefed-up border security. \"It\\'s the only way you can go home and explain to people\" also voting for aid to Ukraine and Israel, said Manchin, who is mulling whether to run for re-election in West Virginia, which is now heavily Republican.\\n\\nSenator Kennedy, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee with Manchin, was upbeat, saying quick progress on more of those 12 bills was possible in coming weeks.\\n\\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'TEHRAN- “Israel May Erase Hamas But Iran Has Already Won” is the title of an article posted on the Bloomberg website on October 11.\\n\\nJessica Karl, Bloomberg’s opinion columnist, quotes Marc Champion as saying: “The Hamas attack is precisely the kind of ostentatiously disruptive operation Iran has wanted to see for years, and offers a welcome distraction from its many internal problems”.\\n\\nConnecting the Hamas operation to Iran is a plot to somehow cover up Tel Aviv’s humiliation. Yet Iran has always stood next to the oppressed Palestinian nation.\\n\\nAlso, the author’s point about Iran’s effort to divert attention from internal problems is the most superficial analysis.\\n\\nOf course, it cannot be denied that Tel Aviv’s weaknesses have a positive effect not only on Iran\\'s internal security, but on the entire region as Israel has a dark history of carrying out assassinations, supporting terrorists, and trying to destabilize countries.\\n\\nIran has left behind the 2022 riots and is moving forward despite the sanctions imposed on the country. However, the Israeli regime is grappling with demonstrations and instability, so connecting the Hamas operation to Iran with this claim that Iran seeks distraction from its internal problems is baseless.\\n\\nIran enjoys the internal tranquility which has paved the way for the country’s development in various aspects.\\n\\nIran has been supporting the oppressed Palestinian people since 1979. Connecting the recent conflicts between the occupying regime and the Palestinian resistance forces to geopolitical competition between Iran and the Israeli regime ignores the sufferings of the Palestinian people since 1948.\\n\\nElsewhere, the author quotes James Stavridis: “The hefty American fleet sends a signal to Iran, Hamas’ principal backer, that any attempt to take advantage of this dangerous moment in Israeli history would face the might of the US military.”\\n\\nIn fact, the presence of the hefty fleet was a signal for Israel to relentlessly break new records in its war crimes in the Gaza Strip. The bombing of Al-Ahli hospital, residential areas, and the killing of women and children would not have been possible without the support of the United States and of course the constant support of the Western media outlets.\\n\\nBloomberg’s writer is among those who run the propaganda campaign with baseless and undocumented claims such as the beheading of children and the use of human shields by Hamas, which was claimed at the beginning of her analysis. These baseless claims have paved the way for Zionists’ repeated crimes and killing spree.\\n\\nRegarding military threats against Iran, Karl quotes Marc Champion: \"Invading a nation of 88 million that’s cut through by mountains and more than 2.5 times the size of Ukraine isn’t an option.\"\\n\\nIt is clear that invading Iran is no longer an option, and in case of an attack, Western writers will not need to refer to the map to know the points of conflict, because everyone will feel the effects of this attack in their surroundings.\\n\\nKarl\\'s final proposal to prevent Iran from supporting Hamas is similar to the analyses written on the restriction of oil sales. She writes: “Saudi Arabia has cut its oil production to try and boost prices, while Iran has increased its production by as much as 700,000 barrels per day,” but Javier Blas says it might not be that way for much longer. Given that Iran is Hamas’ biggest backer, Washington won’t be able to maintain its hands-off approach to the country’s crude production indefinitely.”\\n\\nJavier Blas also says, \"Saudi Arabia significantly reduced its oil production last year, while Iran was able to increase its production during the same period despite U.S. sanctions.\"\\n\\nConsidering that Iran is the biggest supporter of Hamas, Washington cannot indefinitely maintain its passive approach toward the country\\'s crude oil production.\\n\\nSo far, the U.S. has done its best to deprive Iran of oil revenues, while Karl\\'s proposal for further restrictions seems opaque. Probably, she refers to the pirates’ manner of stealing and selling Iran\\'s oil, which completely suits Washington. And of course, Iran will not leave the action unanswered.\\n\\n',\n",

But can investors profit from this market?\\n\\nMoneycontrol brings you a special series featuring experts stocks that could offer good entry points in this ongoing market correction.\\n\\nHere, Gaurang Shah, senior vice president at Geojit Financial Services, shared top bets from the midcap sector. Shah sees 15 percent upside potential in all these names in the span of 18-20 months thanks to their strong outlook for future growth.\\n\\n#1 Indian Hotels | CMP: Rs 376\\n\\nRationale: The Tata Group hotel company is touted to be the best play from the hospitality segment. It started FY24 on a good note with revenue growing in double digits. In September 2023, IHCL clocked its best business as rooms were sold out owing to the G20 summit. Going ahead, the upcoming wedding and holiday season will keep room demand high, further improve occupancy ratios and keep revenue per average room at high levels.\\n\\nThe change in consumer traveling habits, improvement in business travel and recovery in foreign tourist arrivals too will keep IHCL on a strong footing, further bolstering revenue and profitability. As the stock has slipped 8 percent in just five trading sessions, we believe it is a lucrative addition to anyone’s portfolio.\\n\\nValuation-wise, the company trades cheaper at 51 times (x) its price-earning (PE) multiple compared to peers like Lemon Tree Hotels that trades at 71x PE.\\n\\nALSO READ: Top traders on what not to do and where to look for profitable trades\\n\\n#2 Ashok Leyland | CMP: Rs 166\\n\\nRationale: The auto major is a pure play in the commercial vehicle (CV) segment. The company has a strong presence in the truck segment, with a market share of 29 percent as of FY22. It has also been gaining market share in the light commercial vehicle (LCV) segment with its modular platform strategy, which has improved supply chain management to reduce the cost of the vehicle. The company boasts of a strong product pipeline in its EV or electric vehicle segment as well as LCVs.\\n\\nIn addition, the company has charted its plan to outperform the market by increasing its market share in weak territories (North and East markets), expanding its dealer network and launching new products frequently.\\n\\nThe stock has crashed 16 percent from its 52-week highs of Rs 191 and this makes it a solid portfolio addition.\\n\\n#3 KPIT Technology | CMP: Rs 1,120\\n\\nRationale: Unlike other IT companies, KPIT Tech’s essence is embedded in the fact that it supplies software services to automotive companies. Almost all of its revenue comes from the automotive business. So, we believe the potential for scalability is huge given that automotive manufacturers are heavily investing into newer technologies.\\n\\nWith the stock declining over 10 percent in just 10 days, we expect it to be a major wealth booster in the long term as it is touted to be a formidable player in the future mobility segment.\\n\\nThe Pune-based company caters to markets in Europe, US, Japan and China, apart from India. The company’s has outperformed other midcap technology stocks like Coforge and L&T Technology in the last six months.\\n\\nALSO READ: In The Charts: Stocks that have seen maximum carnage. What has changed?\\n\\n#4 Cyient | CMP: Rs 1,604\\n\\nRationale: We believe that the company has all the potential of becoming the next large-cap stock. The company focuses on engineering, manufacturing, data analytics, networks and operations. While the majority of IT companies have reported a weak September quarter, Cyient has consistently delivered good numbers. In Q2, the topline grew 27 percent on-year, whereas profit jumped by 127 percent on-year.\\n\\nValuation-wise, the stock is trading cheaply at 25x PE multiple as against peers like Coforge trading at 41x PE multiple.\\n\\nWith the stock crashing 22 percent from its 52-week high, it is a good opportunity to enter.\\n\\n#5 KEC International | CMP: Rs 637\\n\\nRationale: The stock is a diversified capital goods engineering company that caters to the Indian Railways in a big way.

       " {'articleBody': 'Stop the bombs and save lives! the Palestinian ambassador pleaded at an emotional UN meeting on Thursday on the war in Gaza. But Israel’s envoy was adamant, declaring again, We will not rest until Hamas is obliterated.\\n\\nThe war sparked by Gaza’s Hamas rulers’ surprise attacks on Israel on October 7 played out in the vast hall of the 193-nation General Assembly, where Arab nations expected to adopt a resolution on Friday calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza after the Security Council’s four failed attempts to agree on any action.\\n\\nAt the assembly’s resumed emergency special session on Israeli actions in the Palestinian territories on Thursday, speaker after speaker backed the Arab resolution’s cease-fire call except for Israel’s UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan, who told the 193-member world body.\\n\\nA cease-fire means giving Hamas time to rearm itself, so they can massacre us again. After quoting several Hamas statements vowing to destroy Israel and the Jews, he said, Any call for a cease-fire is not an attempt at peace. It is an attempt to tie Israel’s hands, preventing us from eliminating a huge threat to our citizens.\\n\\nBut the calls for a cease-fire, the protection of Palestinian civilians facing constant Israeli bombardments in Gaza and the delivery of desperately needed food, water, medicine and fuel were often passionate and intense from nearly a dozen countries that spoke Thursday.\\n\\nWhile the Hamas attacks killed some 1,400 Israelis, more than 7,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\\n\\nOn another key issue the more than 220 hostages taken from Israel Iran’s foreign minister said Hamas is ready to release civilian prisoners, and he said the international community must take responsibility for releasing 6,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.\\n\\nIran stands ready to play its part in this very important humanitarian endeavour, along with Qatar and Turkiye, Hossein Amirabdollahian told the assembly.\\n\\nIran is a key backer of Hamas and Qatar has already played a key role in the release of four Israeli civilians. Israel’s Erdan said the country’s action has nothing to do with the Arab-Israeli conflict or the Palestinian question.\\n\\nThis is not a war with the Palestinians. Israel is at war with the genocidal Jihadist Hamas terror organisation, he said.\\n\\nBut Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian UN ambassador, said 70 per cent of those killed in Gaza were children and women. Is this the war some of you are defending? Can this war be defended? These are crimes. This is barbarism, he said. If you do not stop it for all those who were killed, stop it for all those whose lives we can still save, he said.\\n\\nThe anguish over the deaths on both sides was palpable. Mansour’s voice cracked when he spoke of a Palestinian girl killed before the birthday her father had planned and a man hugging the body of his dead mother and saying: Come back, and I will take you wherever you want.\\n\\nErdan’s voice rose when he told the assembly of Hamas fighters firing blindly at hundreds of young people at a concert in southern Israel, parading naked girls that they had raped, and crushing the skulls of babies. He showed a brief video of a badly injured agricultural worker from Thailand being decapitated with a blunt gardening tool.\\n\\nJordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, speaking on behalf of the 22-nation Arab Group, spoke emotionally of children dying under the rubble of homes destroyed by Israeli precision bombs, and some still alive and trapped with no equipment to pull them out. The parents can still hear them. They talk to them helplessly, knowing that they are running out of air and are slowly dying, he said.\\n\\nIn a sharp rebuke to the Israeli ambassador, he told the assembly, I don’t have videos to show you. We respect the dead too much. We respect the pain of their families too much to show videos. Safadi also criticised Erdan for not saying a word about Palestinian lives shattered in this war.\\n\\nDon’t let them tell you this is a war between Muslims and Jews, he said. We value life, Muslim life, Christian life, Jewish life. He was interrupted with applause when he then said, We care about all lives. Don’t let them tell you otherwise. The Jordanian minister also told Israel that it cannot remain above international law requiring protection of civilians, hospitals, schools, homes and other infrastructure.\\n\\nThe right to self-defence is not a license to kill with impunity, he stressed. Safadi also criticised the United States and its allies without naming them.\\n\\nMany among us believe that they are helping Israel by supporting its war, he said. They are not. Instead of sending weapons to Israel, send delegations to open an immediate and viable path to peace. This is how they can help Israel. Iran’s Amirabdollahian accused the United States of directly participating in the war and what he called a genocide against the Palestinians. The genocide in Gaza must stop immediately, he said.\\n\\nHe warned against the uncontrollable consequences of the unlimited financial, arms and operational support by the White House to the Tel Aviv regime which has added to the severe bombardments and killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. The emergency General Assembly meeting resumes Friday morning, with about 100 speakers remaining.\\n\\nThe resolution that Mansour said will be put to a vote on Friday afternoon calls for an immediate cease-fire and demands that all parties respect international law and protect civilians. It says that essential goods including food, water and medicine should be provided in the Gaza Strip. It also calls for Israel to rescind its order for Gazans to move from the north to the south, for maximum restraint and for the release of all civilians.\\n\\nUnlike the Security Council, there are no vetoes in the General Assembly and its resolutions are not legally binding. But they do reflect world opinion and the size of the vote in favour will be closely watched.\\n\\nThe Palestinians have wide support, but Israel’s Erdan called the resolution a disgrace for not even mentioning Hamas and urged countries to oppose it.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'New Delhi: Meta Platforms on Thursday said advertisement revenue from its click-to-message ads in India across its social media and messaging platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has doubled during the September quarter.\\n\\n“Business messaging continues to grow across our services and will be the next major pillar of our business. There are over 600 million conversations between people and businesses every day on our platforms. To give you a sense of what this could look like when it’s scaled globally, every week now, more than 60% of people on WhatsApp in India message a business app account. Our revenue from click-to-message ads in India has doubled year-over-year. This is going to be a really big opportunity for new business AIs,\" Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Meta, said in his remarks to investors after the social media giant reported its fastest revenue growth rate in the past two years.\\n\\nClick-to-message ads involve advertisements that run on social media platforms, such as Meta’s Facebook and Instagram, and direct users to a conversation interface on one of Meta’s Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp chat platforms for businesses and customers to connect with each other. The company earns a commission from businesses using the chat service and selling products through these platforms.\\n\\nIn India, WhatsApp is a key monetization avenue for Meta. As per industry estimates, WhatsApp could have over 480 million monthly active users in India—its highest base worldwide. To push this further, on 19 September, Meta launched multiple new features to double down on WhatsApp as a business offering in India—launching customized conversation tonalities for businesses called ‘Flow’, as well as in-chat payments via Unified Payments Interface (UPI), and verified badges for authentic businesses.\\n\\nMultiple industries, including established businesses and small ventures, are steadily expanding adoption of click-to-message ad formats for user base conversion. A senior marketing industry executive who offers consultation services to multiple top hospitality groups in India said this is the obvious way for the brands.\\n\\n“Companies everywhere are betting on more users getting familiar with text interfaces rather than traditional advertising. Top hotels are using chat interfaces as a way to promote special offers this festive season, and smaller brands with a younger outlook have preferred the medium ever since it was available in India. This could be alarming for Google’s traditional ad business,\" the executive said, requesting anonymity.\\n\\nGoogle, too, has taken note. On 19 October, it launched Business Messages within the Shopping tab on its core search platform. While the latter seeks to grab a share of WhatsApp’s business pie, it remains to be seen how adoption for it grows.\\n\\n“WhatsApp is the default texting app for smartphone users in India, which is what makes it ubiquitous and preferable for businesses. The same isn’t true for Google Search, and it is not a natural instinct for users to find and chat with businesses from within their browsers,\" he added.\\n\\nZuckerberg’s statement comes amid contrasting situations for Meta—while Zuckerberg and chief financial officer Susan Li expressed caution and uncertainty about Meta’s core ad revenue business in 2024, Meta’s India business has continued to grow steadily. The company’s India earnings for FY23, filed with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) on 23 October, showed a 13% increase in gross advertisement revenue to ₹18,308 crore from the previous year, while net profit expanded 19% to ₹352 crore.\\n\\nMeta saw mixed fortunes post-earnings. While it beat analyst estimates to post 21% constant currency quarterly operating revenue growth to $34.1 billion, its share was down 6.1% over previous closing at the time of writing—driven by uncertainty in the upcoming quarters.\\n\\n“We are seeing more volatility at the start of the (December) quarter. That’s in part why we widened our guidance range to capture that uncertainty. While we don’t have material direct revenue exposure to Israel and the Middle East, we have observed softer ad spend in the beginning of the fourth (December) quarter, correlating with the start of the conflict,\" Li said.\\n\\nShe further added that the company’s “revenue outlook is uncertain\" for the next year, and that Meta will “remain disciplined with (its) investment approach\" in the year ahead. Early outtakes from industry analysts pegged Meta’s share price decline to the uncertainty commentary during its earnings call.\\n\\n\"Exciting news!

       " {'articleBody': 'New Delhi: Yesterday, the United Nations Security Council found itself mired in a deepening deadlock as it rejected competing resolutions put forth by the United States and Russia in response to the ongoing crisis in Gaza and Israel. China and Russia wielded their veto power to block a draft resolution sponsored by the United States, while a second Russian-backed resolution failed to secure the required number of votes for adoption.\\n\\nThe U.S.-led draft resolution failed to pass, primarily due to negative votes from permanent Security Council members China and Russia. The vote tally stood at ten in favour, with three against (China, Russia, and the UAE) and two abstentions (Brazil and Mozambique).\\n\\nThe second draft resolution, spearheaded by Russia, also faced rejection as it couldn\\'t garner enough votes in favour. It received support from four Council members (China, Gabon, Russia, and the UAE), faced opposition from the UK and the US, and saw nine abstentions (Albania, Brazil, Ecuador, France, Ghana, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, and Switzerland). For a resolution to be adopted, it requires the backing of at least nine Council members.\\n\\nBoth of these competing resolutions contained similar language, calling for a \"humanitarian ceasefire\" or \"humanitarian pause\" to enable the safe delivery of aid to the desperate civilians in Gaza. Both drafts also condemned the terror attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians that occurred on October 7 and urged immediate action to address the worsening humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.\\n\\nHowever, notable differences existed in the texts. The U.S.-backed proposal explicitly mentioned states\\' inherent right to self-defense, while the Russian-led resolution called for the immediate cancellation of the Israeli forces\\' evacuation order for civilians heading into southern Gaza.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that draft resolutions do not represent the official position of the 15-member Security Council until they are adopted.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Mike Johnson was elected as House speaker after three other candidates were unable to secure enough votes.\\n\\nMike Johnson, a relatively lesser-known Republican from Louisiana, has taken the gavel as the new speaker of the US House of Representatives, ending three weeks of political chaos.\\n\\n“The people’s House is back in business,” Johnson declared after taking the gavel.\\n\\nJohnson, 51, is a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, who backed him for the post. The new speaker has his work cut out amid infighting in his Republican party.\\n\\nHere is what to know about Johnson and his recent election.\\n\\nWhy the speaker race was marred by chaos?\\n\\nThe speaker chair of the House became vacant after Kevin McCarthy was removed on October 3 by the hard-right section of the Republican Party after McCarthy approved a bipartisan temporary funding bill to avoid government shutdown.\\n\\nThe stakes were high for US lawmakers, who were unable to function in the wake of urgent issues such as the looming threat of the US government shut down as well as the Israel-Palestine conflict and the war in Ukraine.\\n\\nA cohort of Republican contenders for the new House speaker role struggled with party infighting. Hours before Johnson’s nomination, Republican whip Tom Emmer dropped his bid after Trump urged Republicans to oppose him. Besides Emmer, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise withdrew while Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan was pushed out from the race after failed attempts at securing the votes.\\n\\nDespite private balloting, Johnson won 220 votes against Democrat Hakeem Jefferies, who won 209. Democrats said they are open to a compromise candidate who would allow the chamber to function. Republicans hold the majority in the House with 221 members as opposed to 212 Democrats.\\n\\nWho is Mike Johnson?\\n\\nJohnson was elected to the Louisiana statehouse in 2015 and ran for Congress successfully in 2016. He now represents Louisiana’s fourth congressional district.\\n\\nHe is the first Louisianan to become speaker and the first southerner to serve as speaker since Republican Newt Gingrich of Georgia in the 1990s.\\n\\nHe describes himself as a “Christian, a husband, a father, a life-long conservative, constitutional law attorney and a small business owner”. He has opposed abortion rights and same sex marriage.\\n\\nAddressing the House after his election, Johnson promised to quickly move forward on conservative priorities, such as support for Israel and border security.\\n\\n“The time for action is now,” Johnson said. “I will not let you down.”\\n\\nPrior to being a Congressman, he was a lawyer specialising in constitutional issues and religious freedom. He successfully defended Louisiana’s same sex marriage ban in 2004. Johnson has drawn on his religious beliefs throughout his work.\\n\\nHe is also the former chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee.\\n\\nBut it remains to be seen how well Johnson will fare at uniting his fractured party as the House immediately plunges into debates over government spending – or in gaining trust from Democrats who are deeply suspicious of his socially conservative record and support for Trump.\\n\\nThe House will have to pass a spending bill by mid-November when the current stopgap measures expire.\\n\\nIs he a Trump ally?\\n\\nJohnson defended and played a role in Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election results following Joe Biden’s victory.\\n\\nI have just called President Trump to say this: \"Stay strong and keep fighting, sir! The nation is depending upon your resolve. We must exhaust every available legal remedy to restore Americans\\' trust in the fairness of our election system.\" — Rep. Mike Johnson (@RepMikeJohnson) November 7, 2020\\n\\nHe has earned the nickname “MAGA Mike” among his hard-right colleagues, a reference to Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again”, which continues to be associated with Trumpian ideals.\\n\\nTrump also backed Johnson in the race saying: “I think he’s gonna be a fantastic speaker”.\\n\\nWhere does he stand on issues?\\n\\nIsrael-Palestine conflict: Johnson supports Israel and his first act as speaker was calling up a resolution reaffirming US commitment to Israel.\\n\\n.@JoeBiden\\'s address to the nation tonight only confirms the urgent need for the U.S. to act in support of our great ally, Israel, as they fight against Hamas terrorists. We must elect a Speaker so the House can take all necessary action to end Hamas forever. — Rep. Mike Johnson (@RepMikeJohnson) October 20, 2023\\n\\nUkraine: He is against sending Ukraine aid to defend itself against Russia, receiving an “F” from advocacy group Republicans for Ukraine.\\n\\nAbortion: The new speaker has defended anti-abortion rights laws in Louisiana and has worked (PDF) to shut down abortion clinics.\\n\\nImmigration: He is in favour of tightening the asylum system and has introduced three bills in the past aimed to do so.\\n\\nLGBTQ rights: Johnson opposes same-sex marriage and introduced a bill in 2022 that would have banned schools from promoting or discussing gender identity.\\n\\nEducation: Johnson has advanced the policy of school prayer. He opposes teachers’ unions.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'U.S. Navy/Getty Images\\n\\n(WASHINGTON) — The U.S. retains the ability to defend itself and hasn’t ruled out retaliatory operations after the Pentagon said American forces were attacked by Iran-backed militants at least 13 times in the Middle East in the last week, President Joe Biden said Wednesday.\\n\\n“My warning to the ayatollah [is] that if they continue to move against those troops, we will respond, and he should be prepared,” Biden told reporters, referring to Iran’s supreme leader.\\n\\nPentagon officials have echoed that.\\n\\n“We will always maintain the inherent right of self-defense. And if there is a response, should we choose to have one, we would do that at a time and place of our choosing,” Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters on Tuesday.\\n\\n“We are preparing for this escalation both in terms of defending our forces and responding decisively,” he said.\\n\\nThere is precedent for a potential military response: In recent years the U.S. has conducted retaliatory airstrikes targeting Iran-backed groups in Iraq following previous attacks on U.S. military bases.\\n\\nTensions have been rising in the Middle East in the wake of a Hamas terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7 which killed more than 1,400 people, according to Israeli officials.\\n\\nIsrael subsequently launched a war on Hamas in Gaza, the neighboring Palestinian territory controlled by the extremist group. More than 6,500 people have since been killed in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry that is run by Hamas. ABC News has not independently confirmed this casualty figure.\\n\\nLeaders from Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group, and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah — all of whom, the U.S. says, are sponsored by Iran — reportedly met in Beirut on Wednesday.\\n\\nAmid the unfolding conflict, the U.S. has surged military assets to the Middle East both in support of Israel’s response to Hamas and as a deterrent to other countries, like Iran and their proxies, becoming involved, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”\\n\\n“We’re concerned about potential escalation. In fact, what we’re seeing is the prospect of a significant escalation of attacks on our troops and our people throughout the region,” Austin told “This Week” co-anchor Jonathan Karl.\\n\\nOne of the American warships, the USS Carney, last week shot down multiple missiles and drones as they crossed the Red Sea after being launched by Iran-backed Houthis from Yemen, the Pentagon has said.\\n\\nRyder said on Wednesday that the missiles had the capability of reaching Israel, though the U.S. hasn’t concluded who the target was.\\n\\nTwo U.S. officials told ABC News around 20 service members have sustained minor injuries, such as cuts and tinnitus, in the 13 attacks by the Iran-sponsored militias in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17.\\n\\nThe attacks have included one-way drone assaults and rocket launches, according to the Pentagon. In the U.S. view, Iran bears responsibility because they have funded and supplied these militias, Ryder said Tuesday.\\n\\nAhead of any potential retaliatory moves, the U.S. has also sought to tamp down fears that the Israel-Hamas war could spiral out in the Middle East — in the kind of escalation not seen there in decades.\\n\\n“The United States does not seek conflict with Iran. We do not want this war to widen,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday. “But if Iran or its proxies attack U.S. personnel anywhere, make no mistake: We will defend our people, we will defend our security — swiftly and decisively.”\\n\\nABC News’ Matt Seyler contributed to this report.\\n\\nCopyright © 2023, ABC Audio.

       " {'articleBody': 'Republicans chose Rep. Mike Johnson as their latest nominee for House speaker desperate to unite their fractious majority and end the chaos, just hours after an earlier pick abruptly withdrew in the face of opposition from Donald Trump.\\n\\nJohnson of Louisiana, a lower-ranked member of the House GOP leadership team, becomes the fourth Republican nominee in what has become an almost absurd cycle of political infighting since Kevin McCarthy’s ouster as GOP factions jockey for power. When the House convenes at noon Wednesday ahead of a floor vote, Johnson, who won the majority behind closed doors, will need almost all Republicans in the public roll call to win the gavel.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“Mike! Mike! Mike!” lawmakers chanted at a press conference late Tuesday night, surrounding Johnson and posing for selfies in a show of support.\\n\\nThree weeks on, the Republicans have been frittering away their majority status — a maddening embarrassment to some, democracy in action to others, but not at all how the House is expected to function. Refusing to unify, far-right members won’t accept a more traditional speaker and moderate conservatives don’t want a hardliner.\\n\\nWhile Johnson had no opponents during the private roll call, some two dozen Republicans did not vote, more than enough to sink his nomination.Anxious and exhausted, Republican lawmakers are desperately trying to move on.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“Pretty sad commentary on governance right now,” said Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark. “Maybe on the fourth or fifth or sixth or 10th try, we’ll get this thing right.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAfter he withdrew Tuesday afternoon, Rep. Tom Emmer briskly left the building where he had been meeting privately with Republicans. He said later at the Capitol that Trump’s opposition did not affect his decision to bow out.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“I made my decision based on my relationship with the conference,” he said, referring to the GOP majority. Emmer said he would support whomever emerges as the new nominee. “We’ll get it done.”Trump, speaking as he left the courtroom in New York where he faces business fraud charges, said his “un-endorsement” must have had an impact on Emmer’s bid.\\n\\n“He wasn’t MAGA,” said Trump, the party’s front-runner for the 2024 presidential election, referring to his Make America Great Again campaign slogan.\\n\\nHouse Republicans returned behind closed doors, where they spend much of their time, desperately searching for a leader who can unite the factions, reopen the House and get the U.S. Congress working again.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAttention quickly turned to Johnson, 51, who was the second highest vote-getter on Tuesday morning’s internal ballots. A lawyer specializing in constitutional issues, Johnson had rallied Republicans around Trump’s legal effort to overturn the 2020 election results. Elevating Johnson to speaker would giving Louisianans two high-ranking GOP leaders, putting him above Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who was rejected by hardliners in his own bid as speaker. But hardliners swiftly resisted Johnson’s bid and a new list of candidates emerged. Among them was Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, a Trump ally who ran third on the morning ballot, and a few others.\\n\\nIn the end, Johnson won 128 votes on the evening ballot, more than any other candidate. McCarthy, who was not on the ballot, won a surprising 43 votes.“Democracy is messy sometimes, but it is our system,” Johnson said afterward, Scalise standing behind him. “We’re going to restore your trust in what we do here.”One idea circulating, first reported by NBC News, was to reinstall McCarthy as speaker with hardline Rep. Jim Jordan in a new leadership role.\\n\\nIt was being pitched as a way to unite the conference, lawmakers said, but many said it would not fly.“I think sometimes it’s good to have fresh ideas and fresh people,” said Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind.\\n\\nWhile Emmer won a simple majority in a morning roll call behind closed doors — 117 votes — he lost more than two dozen Republicans, leaving him far short of what will be needed during a House floor tally ahead. With Republicans controlling the House 221-212 over Democrats, any GOP nominee can afford just a few detractors to win the gavel. Trump allies, including the influential hard-right instigator Steve Bannon, have been critical of Emmer. Some point to his support of a same-sex marriage initiative and perceived criticisms of the former president. Among the far-right groups pressuring lawmakers over the speaker’s vote, some quickly attacked Emmer.\\n\\nHaving rejected the top replacements, Scalise and the Trump-backed Jordan, there is no longer any obvious choice for the job.“We’re in the same cul-de-sac,” said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., the chairman of the far-right House Freedom Caucus.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nYet Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., one of the hardliners, said, “This is what democracy looks like.”Republicans have been flailing all month, unable to conduct routine business as they fight amongst themselves with daunting challenges ahead. The federal government risks a shutdown in a matter of weeks if Congress fails to pass funding legislation by a Nov. 17 deadline to keep services and offices running. More immediately, President Joe Biden has asked Congress to provide $105 billion in aid — to help Israel and Ukraine amid their wars and to shore up the U.S. border with Mexico. Federal aviation and farming programs face expiration without action.\\n\\nMany hardliners have been resisting a leader who voted for the budget deal that McCarthy struck with Biden earlier this year, which set federal spending levels that far-right Republicans don’t agree with and now want to undo. They are pursuing steeper cuts to federal programs and services with next month’s funding deadline.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said she wanted assurances the candidates would pursue impeachment inquiries into Biden and other top Cabinet officials.\\n\\nDuring the turmoil, the House is now led by a nominal interim speaker pro tempore, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the bow tie-wearing chairman of the Financial Services Committee. His main job is to elect a more permanent speaker.\\n\\nSome Republicans — and Democrats — would like to simply give McHenry more power to get on with the routine business of governing. But McHenry, the first person to be in the position that was created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks as an emergency measure, has declined to back those overtures.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'India is often called a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy global economy. But no one is immune to spillovers from international developments.\\n\\nIt has been a difficult few days for Indian financial markets. The Nifty closed below 19,000 on October 26 and is down nearly 4 percent over last week. And if this trend holds, foreign portfolio investors will be net sellers again from the local equity markets in October, with September\\'s $1.78 billion worth of net outflows already almost eclipsed by outflows of $1.68 billion so far this month.\\n\\nBut the rout in the domestic stock markets will not be a surprise to the Indian government, with the Finance Ministry having recently warned of the spillover risks from the US.\\n\\nAlso Read: Market rout – 7 critical questions answered\\n\\n\"At current levels, US stock markets have greater downside risk than upside. If the downside materialises, it will have spillover effects on other markets,\" the Finance Ministry\\'s Monthly Economic Review report had said on October 23. At the same time, it had also said that the macroeconomic outlook for the Indian economy for the current financial year is \"bright\" and \"solidly underpinned by strong domestic fundamentals\".\\n\\nBut what exactly – and how strong – are these fundamentals?\\n\\nThe macros are alright\\n\\nThere is broad general agreement that India\\'s headline macroeconomic numbers are fairly decent and are on the road to improvement.\\n\\nConsider GDP growth, which has exceeded economists\\' expectations in each of the first two quarters of 2023. While growth is expected to decline to sub-6 percent by March 2024, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) sees it jumping to 6.6 percent in April-June 2024. And while base effects continue to play a role, it is telling that the government and the RBI\\'s optimistic expectations for 6.5 percent growth this year have been panning out fairly nicely.\\n\\nAs is always the case, the situation below the headline growth number is not as straightforward, with different data not tugging in the same, rosy direction. Take the Purchasing Managers\\' Indices (PMI), for instance, which have hit multi-year highs in 2023, with the services PMI in particular displaying stunning growth.\\n\\nMeanwhile, industrial growth as per the Index of Industrial Production has been more sedate. Of course, it must be noted that IIP growth and the PMIs are not similar measures of activity – the first compares industrial output on a year-on-year basis while the latter considers several parameters through its surveys and derives an index which looks at changes on a month-on-month basis.\\n\\nAlso Read: \\'Best of both worlds\\' – economists give thumbs-up to CPI, IIP data\\n\\nHowever, the latest IIP growth print was a 14-month high of 10.3 percent. At the same time, the composite PMI – manufacturing and services sectors taken together – have been above 60 in five of the last six months, well above the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion in activity.\\n\\nOn the price front, matters are indeed improving, with headline retail inflation returning to the RBI\\'s two to six percent tolerance range in September. In fact, the central bank\\'s repeated reiteration of its commitment to the four percent medium-term target is reinforcing the credibility of the flexible inflation targeting framework, with markets postponing their rate cut expectations to mid-2024 from late 2023.\\n\\nPerhaps more important than the recent fall in inflation is the more prolonged moderation in core inflation, which has cooled to 4.5 percent.\\n\\nFinancials – internal and external\\n\\nIf growth and inflation are seemingly on the right track, the government\\'s finances are doing even better. The Centre\\'s fiscal deficit – the most crucial indicator of the health of the exchequer – for the first five months of 2023-24 is a comfortable 36 percent of the full-year\\'s target. August in particular was a good month for the central government as direct tax collections performed a dramatic U-turn and posted stupendous growth numbers. On the expenditure side, capex has kept pace and has crossed Rs five lakh crore in October, according to a government source.\\n\\nAlso Read: No reason for govt to deviate from medium-term fiscal deficit path, says source\\n\\nOverall, the fiscal deficit target of 5.9 percent of GDP looks eminently achievable, according to the government.\\n\\nThe external balance, on the other hand, is a bit tricky, but mostly because of factors outside India\\'s control. The war between Russia and Ukraine continues, and geopolitical tensions have only increased due to the Israel-Hamas conflict and the possibility of other nations in West Asia being dragged in.\\n\\nCompleting the third and fourth sides of the global headache quadrilateral are the US and Chinese economies. While the rapid rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and fears of \\'higher for longer\\' have pushed US bond yields to 16-year highs, the real estate sector in the world\\'s second-largest economy is causing severe heartburn.\\n\\nDespite these headwinds, India\\'s external performance – merchandise exports notwithstanding – has been rather stable – the rupee has depreciated only slightly over the course of 2023 even though the Dollar Index has gone past 106. And the buffers remain robust, with the foreign exchange reserves at $586 billion as of October 13 – higher than what the RBI started 2023 with.\\n\\nAll in all, as the Finance Ministry\\'s monthly report said, India will remain the fastest-growing major economy in the world this year. With foreign investors expected to lap up Indian sovereign debt once government bonds are included in JPMorgan\\'s global indices starting June 2024, money, especially for the long term, is only going to keep flowing in.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': '(NewsNation) — International law specifies what countries can and can’t do during wartime. Both Israel and Hamas have been accused of breaking them.\\n\\nThe rules of armed conflict are governed by a set of international laws, including the Geneva Conventions, which almost every country has agreed to. They forbid the intentional targeting of civilians, ban torture, hostage-taking and other inhumane treatments.\\n\\n“The deliberate cruelty of Hamas vividly reminds me of ISIS- blood thirsty, fanatic and hateful,” said U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.\\n\\n“When Hamas launched several hundred missiles on that fateful Saturday and then attacked various civilian objects and towns along the border, destroying human beings, that in and of itself was a war crime, “said David Crane the founding chief prosecutor of the United Nations for Sierra Leone. “There is one real cornerstone, hard rock principle in the laws of armed conflict, and that is civilians and civilian objects can never be intentionally targeted.”\\n\\nBut the brutality of the attacks by Hamas doesn’t give Israel the ability to attack freely – it is supposed to adhere to international humanitarian laws as well.\\n\\n“You are a Jewish state, but you’re also a democracy like the United States. You don’t live by the rules of terrorists. You live by the rule of law. And when conflicts flare, you live by the law of war. What sets us apart from the terrorists is we believe in the fundamental dignity of every human life,” President Joe Biden said.\\n\\nTo date, Palestinian health authorities estimate over 2,800 civilians – including children – have been killed by Israeli airstrikes. Nearly a week after the attacks by Hamas on Israel and its people, Israel ordered the evacuation of a million Palestinians in northern Gaza, cutting off water and power to the residents there.\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch claims Israel used munitions with white phosphorus, which, while not prohibited, is criticized when used in crowded areas. The Israeli Defense Forces denies deploying white phosphorus as a weapon in Gaza.\\n\\n“It is arguably against international humanitarian law to coerce an entire population to move. And it’s clearly not a well-considered policy if there are no facilities available for those people when they do move,” Richard Makepeace, a former British diplomat in Jerusalem, said.\\n\\nA United Nations Commission of Inquiry is actively gathering and safeguarding evidence of war crimes committed by all parties in the ongoing conflict. This evidence may be used in the existing investigation conducted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) regarding the situation in the Palestinian territories.\\n\\nThe ICC, based in the Netherlands, possesses the authority to prosecute government officials for breaches of international law and can also order compensation for victims. However, some nations, such as the United States, Russia, and Israel, do not acknowledge the jurisdiction of the ICC. The ICC lacks its own law enforcement agency to enforce arrest warrants.\\n\\nCrane said that Israel knows and abides by the laws of armed conflict and therefore faces difficult choices ahead.\\n\\n“They are in an impossible situation. They want to follow the law. You have an opponent who does not follow the laws of armed conflict. Israelis have a very hard choice. They have a military object, but if they target it, they drop the building and kill civilians,” Crane said.',\n",

Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\\n\\nFinally, after 22 days and four nominees, House Republicans on Wednesday picked Mike Johnson to replace deposed Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Finally would be the most important word in that previous sentence. Mike Johnson, a largely unknown figure in the GOP and a surprise choice, may be the least.\\n\\nThe embarrassing intra-party squabble that stretched for three weeks and paralyzed Congress grew more perilous with each passing day as government funding deadlines raced closer, a war between Israel’s government and Hamas erupted in the Middle East, and Ukraine’s defense against Russia became more iffy. The elevation of Johnson, a Louisiana lawyer who arrived in Washington the same month Donald Trump was inaugurated, came so suddenly and seemingly out of nowhere that Johnson’s wife couldn’t even make it to the Capitol in time to see her husband be elevated to just behind the Vice President in terms of constitutional power.\\n\\n“She couldn’t get a flight in time. This happened sort of suddenly,” Johnson said in his first speech as the new face of House Republicans, a fractured collection of competing agendas, ideologies, and personalities that may prove ungovernable in short order.\\n\\nWith a margin of no more than five votes, Johnson is starting his attempt at governing with one of the smallest majorities for a new Speaker in a century. Even his fellow Republicans have doubts about his longevity in the role. The fourth-term lawmaker from Shreveport, La., told his colleagues he would run the chamber by not really running it himself. He promised a decentralized power structure and pledged that lawmakers themselves would have as much autonomy as they believed they needed. Yet he has no plans to change the rule that allowed McCarthy’s ouster at the hands of just a handful of troublemakers, leaving Johnson in an equally precarious position and at the mercy of the same mercurial whims of raconteurs.\\n\\nTo listen to Johnson’s address on Wednesday, it’s tempting to think Republicans had settled on a middle-of-the-road figure who could bridge the deep divides between the parties and even fellow Republicans. “I do look forward to working with you on behalf of the American people. I know we see things from very different points of view,” Johnson said, addressing both his new playground and specifically Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. “But I know that in your heart you love and care about this country and want to do what’s right. So we’re going to find common ground.”\\n\\nBut it also quickly became clear that Johnson’s optimism is matched only by his hard-right credentials. “I don’t believe there are any coincidences in a matter like this. I believe that Scripture, the Bible is very clear that God is the one that raises up those in authority. He raised up each of you. All of us,” Johnson told the House. “And I believe that God has ordained and allowed us to be brought here for this specific moment in this time.”\\n\\nJohnson’s right-wing views will draw plenty of attention in the coming days but he is not an extreme outlier among his fellow House’s Republicans. In fact, he became the vice chairman of the conference and earlier served as the chair of the Republican Study Committee, the conservative ideas factory inside the House. Colleagues described him as cordial, even to political opposites. Whereas some in the MAGA wing of the GOP delight in being in-your-face aggressive, Johnson takes a choir-master’s lilt and lies in wait until the right moment. All of which, of course, makes for an entirely unpredictable Speakership.\\n\\nBut it’s indisputable that Johnson is a different flavor of Republican than his predecessor. While McCarthy dabbled in his share of election denialism after Joe Biden’s 2020 victory Johnson was among the biggest—if not loudest—defenders of Trump. Johnson circulated a friend-of-the-court brief in the House, collecting more than 100 signatures during a campaign that some found to be menacing, and on Jan. 6, 2021, he led the effort to keep Trump in power. He has told colleagues that the Biden presidency is one that will have an asterisk attached to it.\\n\\nAsked about his election denialism on Tuesday, Johnson did not answer. His colleagues told the reporter to “shut up” and booed her.\\n\\nAround the Capitol, Democratic staffers quickly settled on their theme that Johnson was merely a softer spoken version of Jim Jordan, one of the contenders who sought to follow McCarthy but was deemed too extreme or caustic to be palatable to enough Republicans. Democrats were quick to point out Johnson’s opposition to abortion rights, LGBTQ rights, even funding for veterans and Ukrainians. But for now, Johnson is working with the slightest of national profiles, giving him something of a blank slate with the American public. At least for now, he is no Nancy Pelosi or Newt Gingrich, the kind of Speaker who members of the opposite party could invoke and be confident that the ka-ching of fundraising would follow.\\n\\nJohnson told his colleagues that the House’s first item of business would be a measure to support Israel in its war against Hamas, setting the chamber up to do its job for the first time in three full weeks. But that’s just one of the pressing items facing this neophyte Speaker who comes to office with one of the thinnest political resumes in decades and with the least experience in 140 years. The White House and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell alike have urged Congress to couple funding for Israel with money for Ukraine. The government is also due to run out of money in mid-November and Johnson has told colleagues to expect another stopgap spending resolution, likely into the new year to avoid a holiday-time threat of a shutdown.\\n\\nDuring previous votes on Ukraine and on government funding, Johnson was a nay. But a rank-and-file lawmaker’s no—even one he says is mischaracterized—is seldom predictive of what he will allow to come to the floor as Speaker. Or at least that’s what lawmakers desperate for the House to return to what passes for functionality are counting on. Then again, the last three weeks have shown not just how broken the Republican Party has become, but how much Congress is hobbling from crisis to crisis. More than specific pieces of legislation, Johnson’s legacy-in-making could well be to fix the half of the Capitol he now controls. Or at least find some spackling to patch the cracks in the plaster.\\n\\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C. Brief newsletter.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Pic Credit: Israel Diaries\\n\\nBy Levina\\n\\nTunnel rat is a term that brings back myriad nightmarish memories for Australian, American, and New Zealander soldiers. These soldiers, who were called tunnel rats, were trained to search and destroy tunnels in Vietnam, an experience from which not many soldiers survived. Later, Russians faced the same fate as Americans in Afghanistan, and a decade later, Israeli soldiers were faced with the same gargantuan task of clearing tunnels created by terrorists. A humble reminder: neither Russian soldiers (of the Soviet Union) nor American soldiers won the war against their respective enemies, who relied on complex tunnel maze.\\n\\nIn an epoch where we have the best of technology, underground warfare takes us back to the stone-age ways of fighting a war. Being ethical under such circumstances is the easiest route to defeat. There are about 1300 tunnels located under the Gazan cities. On average, each tunnel is approximately 2 m high and 1 m wide and equipped with lights, electricity, and sometimes tracks for transporting materials. The tunnels are often booby-trapped with improvised explosive devices.\\n\\nThe Dangerous Metro:\\n\\nNine years ago, during one of the meetings with the Israeli security cabinet, Benjamin Netanyahu, the longest-serving PM of Israel, said that the Israeli Army had thwarted an attack by 200 heavily armed Hamas terrorists who were planning to carry out an attack on Israeli cities. Their plan was to kill, loot, rape, and abduct Israelis on the Jewish high holy day of Rosh Hashanah. The tunnels connecting Gaza to Israeli communities were going to be utilised for this nefarious purpose.\\n\\nOn September 24th, 2014, Israelis were lucky that the terrorist attack was thwarted, but on October 7th, 2023, their luck had run out.\\n\\nNobody took these tunnels seriously till 2001, when, during the second Palestinian Intifada, Hamas exploded 200 kg of TNT in a tunnel under an Israeli outpost, which destroyed the outpost of Termit in Rafah. Families living in Rafah are said to know the tunnels intimately, which were initially used for smuggling and later developed into a network of tunnels that ran for many kilometers underground. This network of tunnels has earned an epithet: the Gaza Metro!\\n\\nIsraeli soldiers claim that these tunnels are used for smuggling goods and transporting people. However, the not-so-innocuous purposes of the Gaza Metro include storing rockets, launchers, and ammunition caches. Additionally, these underground structures are sporadically used to house Hamas’s command and control centers, shielding them from the hawk eyes of Israeli surveillance drones and the Israeli Defence Force’s aircrafts.\\n\\nTwo days after Hamas carried out the recent attack inside Israel, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) released a video showcasing the extent of these tunnels to the Israeli military and the world. Below is a screenshot of the rockets stored underground.\\n\\nScreengrab from IRGC’s video\\n\\nThe IRGC’s video is mind-boggling, and that is the reason it has been released. An ideal case of psyops!\\n\\nHamas is aware of the Israeli military’s substantial armament and security strategies, which are centered around preemptive and protective measures. It is also aware that Hamas is a technologically and militarily inferior to Israeli forces.\\n\\nHow does one make a behemoth enemy bend its knees?\\n\\nA combination of guerilla warfare and psychological warfare is the answer.\\n\\nHamas’s strategy is to use tunnels to deliver a devastating blow to the Israeli defense forces, rendering them incapable of mounting a counterattack and leaving the defending side, such as an IDF soldier, without the means to defend themselves or escape from the assault. This situation can be demoralizing for soldiers in a conventional army.\\n\\nThe Israeli Army is presently encountering a behemoth and unparalleled challenge posed by tunnel warfare. It has emerged as one of the most dangerous guerilla tactics ever to be faced by conventional armies like the Israeli armed forces, the US Army, and the Indian Defence Forces. It is common knowledge that terrorists supported by Pakistan enter India through tunnels constructed by smugglers along the Indo-Pakistan border. Smugglers and terrorists continue to create and use such tunnels unabated.\\n\\nCu Chi Tunnels, the inspiration:\\n\\nIn the 1960’s, a technologically superior American Army fighting the Viet Cong was baffled by the complex network of tunnels that existed under Cu Chi City in Vietnam. This vast labyrinth of tunnels extended to other parts of the country too.\\n\\nThe Cu Chi tunnels have witnessed some of the most intense battles during the Vietnam War, where American soldiers were faced with an enemy who could escape into thin air in the middle of a chase and fire at them from the secret tunnel openings.\\n\\nThese tunnels (akin to Hamas’s tunnels) served the purpose of hiding weapons, providing safety to the enemy, and placing booby traps for the enemy soldiers who dared to enter them. But Cu Chi tunnels were far more sophisticated than Hamas’s concrete tunnels.\\n\\nThere have been times when American soldiers discovered secret offices, bunker beds for Viet Cong soldiers, and booby traps inside the tunnels. Although the Cu Chi tunnels were significantly more advanced than those in Gaza, the Vietnamese did not employ concrete to line their tunnels. Tunnels in Vietnam, some of which still exist, had frequent turns and twists, as well as booby traps in which cobras, poisonous scorpions, and sharp bamboo knives with human excreta on them were hidden. These measures ensured a painful and slow death for the victims. The Cu Chi tunnels were designed with bends every few metres to disorient any opponent entering the tunnels. Those American soldiers who survived to tell their stories caused a dent in the psyche of others, and fear of Vietnamese strategies. VietCong did not believe in giving the enemy an option of immediate death.\\n\\nWhilst al Qaeda’s tunnels were located in the mountains of Afghanistan and the Viet Cong’s in the jungles of Southeast Asia, Hamas constructed the Metro underneath one of the most densely populated places on Earth—Gaza Strip.\\n\\nYou may also watch video on tunnels in Kashmir in our video>>\\n\\nThe Economics of tunnels!\\n\\nIn 2021, Hamas claimed that the total length of the tunnel network was 500 km, which is approximately the distance between London and Paris. Albeit the total length of Gaza is just 41 km and it is 6 to 12 km wide, ergo one can safely assume that the tunnel network has been created in layers and in a serpentine manner under Gazan cities. Approximately 2.2 million people live here. If the claim is true, then the Israeli military is already aware of the herculean task it must undertake to destroy the Metro.\\n\\nAccording to Israel, Hamas may have spent $30–90 million to construct the tunnel network over the years and may have used about 600,000 tonnes of concrete. Tunnels are reinforced by concrete panels. Ostensibly, for a very long time now, Israeli authorities claim that Hamas has been constructing tunnels by diverting concrete meant for civilian and humanitarian purposes.\\n\\nHow does Israel plan to destroy the Tunnels?\\n\\nMost of these tunnels have access points located inside the kitchen of a home, in the prayer room of a religious structure, or at times in the most unexpected places, like an animal farm. In December 2022, the United Nations discovered a tunnel under an UN-run school in Gaza. Shocking, but true!\\n\\nUsing civilians as human shields is an age-old tactic used by terrorist organizations. This factor adds to the woes of soldiers of the attacking Army. Fighting urban warfare is already a complicated affair, and tunnel warfare makes it more excruciating for the conventional army. FIBUA—fighting in built-up areas causes heavy losses for the conventional army. For every five terrorists killed, one soldier loses his life; this figure has remained the same for conventional armies across the world.\\n\\nIn the past, Israel has attempted to eliminate some of these tunnels using other methods, such as combat engineering and the construction of an underground border wall stretching several meters to deter tunnel assaults. Israeli forces also used bunker buster known as the GB U28 against these tunnels during the Gaza War of 2008–2009. In 2021, Israel requested the GBU 72 bombs from the United States to replace its GBU-28.\\n\\nGBU 72 was developed to overcome hardened, deeply buried targets. The GBU 72 not only obliterates nearby objects but also generates a shockwave capable of inducing caverns in subterranean structures even farther from the intended targets. But bunker buster ammunition is costly; it is said that about 125 units of GBU 72 may cost up to $36 million.\\n\\nIn the Vietnam War, America was using Daisy cutters, a type of fuse designed to detonate an aerial bomb at or above ground level, these were often used with BLU-82B bombs. Though effective in destroying tunnels, daisy cutters could not deter Viet Cong from constructing new tunnels and traps.\\n\\nDuring Operation Guardians of the Walls in May 2021, Israeli airstrikes destroyed over 100 km of tunnel network inside Gaza, and 7 months later, the Israeli Ministry of Defence announced that a 65 km underground barrier/wall to deal with the threat of cross-border tunnel assaults along the border with Gaza had been completed.\\n\\nIt is evident that tunnel warfare is employed by the weaker side to wage a war of attrition against the conventional army. Experiences of conventional armies in Vietnam and Afghanistan demonstrate that tunnel warfare tactics, over time, result in fatigued soldiers and ultimately compel the stronger opponent to come to the negotiation table. The Israeli defense forces will need to find an avant-garde solution for tunnel warfare.\\n\\nOn July 17, 2014, 23 terrorists from the Qassam Brigade, the military branch of Hamas, survived Israeli shelling but were trapped in the tunnel for 40–45 days. They were taken out of the tunnel in early August 2014, when a ceasefire was announced. This incident is a clear sign that tunnels, even if superficially bombed, still have the probability of remaining intact. Israel’s biggest challenge will be to not have a city under a city in Gaza.\\n\\nShare this: Twitter\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\n\\nLike this: Like Loading...',\n",

It calls China a threat only to find a convenient pretext for the US to sustain its military hegemony.

We have no intention to get involved in any nuclear arms race with any country.

For any country, as long as they do not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against China, they have nothing to worry about being threatened by China’s nuclear weapons.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe US sits on the largest and most advanced nuclear arsenal in the world. It follows a first-use nuclear deterrence policy, keeps making enormous investment to upgrade its nuclear triad, advances forward deployment of strategic forces, and strengthens extended deterrence for its allies.

Can you share some details on that?\\n\\n\\n\\nMao Ning: After the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out on October 7, more than 280 Chinese citizens were stranded in Sderot in southern Israel and faced high security risk. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs directed the Chinese Embassy in Israel to act swiftly to organize their relocation and evacuation. With the concerted efforts on the ground and back home, the stranded Chinese nationals have all left Sderot. Some have returned to China on commercial flights.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the numbers we have at this point, since the conflict broke out, over 1,000 Chinese nationals have left Israel for China or a third country. We will continue to work hard to assist our fellow citizens.\\n\\n\\n\\nShenzhen TV: The Iranian Foreign Ministry said on October 18 that UN Security Council restrictions on Iran’s ballistic missiles were lifted on that day. The US and some other countries issued a joint statement on the same day announcing sanctions on Iran’s missile activities. What’s China’s comment?\\n\\n\\n\\nMao Ning: The JCPOA and the Security Council Resolution 2231 are important outcomes of the political settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue and should be implemented fully and faithfully. China supports lifting relevant restrictions and unilateral sanctions on Iran as slated in the Security Council Resolution and the JCPOA and call on parties concerned to uphold the authority and effectiveness of the two documents with concrete actions, take constructive steps to advance diplomatic efforts to resume compliance with the JCPOA, and uphold the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and peace and stability in the Middle East.\\n\\n\\n\\nBloomberg: US Ambassador Nicholas Burns called on the Chinese government to denounce terrorism by Hamas. He also cited Beijing’s stance toward the group as yet another challenge in the China-US relationship. How do you respond to this? And why hasn’t China mentioned the word “Hamas” as far as I know since the attack on Israel? It is a group that governs Gaza.\\n\\n\\n\\nMao Ning: On the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict, China stands on the side of peace, equity and justice. We oppose all violent attacks against civilians and civilian facilities, condemn any violation of international law, and call on all parties to immediately stop fighting, protect civilians and avert a humanitarian disaster.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe always believe that in dealing with international and regional hotspot issues, major countries need to be objective and just, lead by example in abiding by international law and play a constructive role for a political settlement. We will continue to work with the international community to deescalate the situation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYonhap News Agency: According to reports, the ROK government has recently proposed to China and Japan of holding a trilateral foreign ministers’ meeting around November 26 in Busan and the three sides are working on the program of the meeting. Could you confirm this? Will China take part in the trilateral foreign ministers’ meeting?\\n\\n\\n\\nMao Ning: China, Japan and the ROK are close neighbors. Trilateral cooperation serves the common interests of all three countries. The three sides are in contact on the dates of the China-Japan-ROK foreign ministers’ meeting.\\n\\n\\n\\nBloomberg: I’m just curious why did China refuse to say the word “Hamas”? It’s the organization that runs Gaza.\\n\\n\\n\\nMao Ning: Our position on the current situation is very clear.\\n\\n\\n\\nReuters: Viet Nam’s President invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to Hanoi and Putin has accepted the invitation. Has Viet Nam invited President Xi to visit Hanoi too?\\n\\n\\n\\nMao Ning: The invitation to President Putin to visit Hanoi is a bilateral arrangement between Viet Nam and Russia. As to high-level visit between China and Viet Nam, I don’t have any specific information to share at the moment.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Erdan informed the members that the victim seen in the video was not Israeli or Jewish, but an agricultural worker from Thailand. “One can see a terribly injured civilian – bloodied, yet alive – laying on the ground as a Hamas savage screaming Allahu Akbar repeatedly pummels the man’s neck with a garden hoe in order to decapitate him,” Erdan said at the UN podium.\\n\\nNotably, the UN General Assembly began a two-day meeting on the Middle East yesterday. The assembly is set to vote today on a resolution drafted by Arab states regarding a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“The October 7th Massacre and what ensued has nothing to do with the Palestinians, nothing. It has nothing to do with the Arab-Israeli conflict or the Palestinian question. This is not a war with the Palestinians. Israel is at war with the genocidal jihadist Hamas terror organization only.

       " {'articleBody': 'Russia’s military conducted drills on Wednesday, overseen by President Vladimir Putin, that simulated a nuclear strike in response to a nuclear attack and involved multiple practice launches of ballistic and cruise missiles.\\n\\nThe Kremlin ’s announcement of the exercise came hours after the upper house of the Russian parliament revoked the ratification of a global nuclear test ban in what Moscow has described as a move to establish parity with the United States.\\n\\nThe bill to end ratification will now be sent to Putin for final approval. The lower house approved it last week.\\n\\nThe state television showed Putin directing the exercise via video call with top military officials. Russia’s Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu said the purpose of the drills is to practice dealing a massive nuclear strike with strategic offensive forces in response to a nuclear strike by the enemy.\\n\\nWhile similar drills are held every autumn, Shoigu’s pointed comments came amid soaring tensions between Russia and the West over the fighting in Ukraine.\\n\\nThe vote to rescind the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in the Russian Parliament follows a statement from Putin, who warned earlier this month that Moscow could revoke its 2000 decision to ratify the bill to mirror the stand taken by the U.S., which has signed but not ratified the nuclear test ban.\\n\\nThe CTBT, adopted in 1996, bans all nuclear explosions anywhere in the world but the treaty was never fully implemented.

Putin has noted that while some experts have argued that it’s necessary to conduct nuclear tests, he hasn’t yet formed an opinion on the issue.\\n\\nRussia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said earlier this month that Moscow will continue to respect the ban and will only resume nuclear tests if Washington does it first.\\n\\nRyabkov said Wednesday that the Russian Foreign Ministry had received U.S. proposals to resume a dialogue on strategic stability and arms control issues, but noted that Moscow doesn’t consider it possible in the current political environment.\\n\\n\"We aren’t ready for it because the return to a dialogue on strategic stability … as it was conducted in the past is impossible until the U.S. revises its deeply hostile policy course in relation to Russia,\" Ryabkov told reporters in comments carried by Russian news agencies.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Ukraine Awaits Brutal Winter with World Attention Focused on Middle East\\n\\nWith the world’s attention fixed on the Middle East, officials in Ukraine say they are facing a new threat: crude Russian drones that appear to be launched with the sole intention of exhausting Ukrainian rockets fired to shoot them down.\\n\\nAccording to Ukrainian national television, the small drones carry reflectors to ensure they are detected, sometimes taking pictures to identify the sites of anti-aircraft radars and missile systems. Built from cheap components readily available online, each drone is estimated to cost around $1,500, less than each of the sometimes multiple rockets fired to bring them down, Reuters said.\\n\\nRussian television pundits have reacted to the unexpected Oct. 7 Hamas assault against Israel with barely concealed glee, predicting conflict in the Middle East will dramatically reduce Western support for Kyiv.\\n\\nMany Ukrainian commentators offer the same analysis, worrying in particular that outrage at mounting Palestinian casualties in Gaza and at the Hamas attacks will devastate already fragile support for Ukraine among poorer \"Global South\" nations and divert military aid the Kyiv government badly needs.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Russia announced its defense spending for 2024 would be almost $110 billion, three times the level before its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and almost 30% of government spending.\\n\\nUkraine intends to spend around $40 billion on defense next year, roughly half the government budget and 20% of the country’s entire economic output – but it is also counting on tens of billions more in foreign military aid, as long as Western donors are still willing to provide it.\\n\\nWhen it comes to air defense rockets and artillery shells, Kyiv is now competing directly with Israel for Western supplies, especially from the United States. In recent weeks, Russian and Ukrainian forces have been on the offensive ahead of deteriorating weather likely to limit movement.\\n\\nEach has made occasional advances, with elements of two Ukrainian marine brigades reported to have broken through on the eastern bank of the Dnipro river, potentially threatening Russian artillery positions that have repeatedly shelled the recaptured Ukrainian city of Kherson.\\n\\nAn advance there might allow Kyiv to better threaten Russian-held Crimea, already under Ukrainian strikes from newly supplied Western missiles that have forced Russia’s Black Sea Fleet to seek another base.\\n\\nWhile Ukrainian officials would not confirm the landings, military bloggers and media citing military sources said the marines had seized at least three small settlements. Ukrainian troops on the far bank were being resupplied by small boats under heavy fire, they said.\\n\\nRussian forces foiled several attempts by Ukrainian units to cross the Dnipro River, Russia\\'s defense ministry said on Sunday.\\n\\nOn Monday, the Kyiv Post reported an appeal by Robert Brovdi, commander of a Ukrainian drone unit supported through crowdfunding, for Zodiac-type dinghies to support the offensive. By Tuesday, he said he had raised almost $1 million, roughly a third of the amount he said was needed to deliver up to 100 craft.\\n\\nFurther east in the Donbas, Russian forces have been making their own assault against heavily fortified Ukrainian strongholds around Avdiivka, among the last significant settlements in the region not under the control of Russian-speaking separatists.\\n\\nWINTER INFRASTRUCTURE BATTLE\\n\\nA shortage of personnel is a growing problem for both sides. US officials estimated in August that 70,000 to 80,000 Russian troops had been killed or wounded so far in Ukraine, with recruitment challenges forcing the Kremlin to turn to prisoners and unfit and older conscripts. Ukraine will not discuss its losses, but in August President Volodymyr Zelenskiy fired the heads of each regional recruiting command after a string of scandals over bribery and other efforts to avoid the draft.\\n\\nUkrainian officials say they expect Russia to again strike Ukraine’s energy infrastructure this winter in the hope of freezing the population, also attacking Kyiv’s ability to earn money from exports.\\n\\nRussian drones and missiles have also repeatedly hit the port of Odessa and along the Danube, damaging harbor infrastructure. Ukraine’s September grain exports were 50% down on a year earlier, something traders and industry experts said was largely down to those attacks.\\n\\nRussia has often used Iranian drones to target infrastructure – although it remains unclear if conflict in the Middle East will prompt Tehran, a strong supporter of Hamas, to limit such supplies.\\n\\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was in Iran this week as part of a meeting of nations in the Caucasus, following a visit to North Korea. Both he and Russian leader Vladimir Putin also visited China, signing a 12-year deal to export grain.\\n\\nUkraine will need every air defense missile it can get throughout the winter – hence Russia’s willingness to sacrifice its most basic drones. A growing shortage of artillery shells is if anything more serious, with frontline reports suggesting Ukrainian troops are struggling to get enough ammunition to use roughly 350 donated Western-caliber artillery pieces.\\n\\nThe United States and European Union have each pledged to send Ukraine roughly a million 155-mm shells, with the US donation in part coming from strategic stocks the Pentagon keeps in Israel. On Monday, a senior Pentagon official confirmed some of those were being reallocated back to Israeli forces.\\n\\nNORTH KOREAN SHIPMENTS\\n\\nWhether the Pentagon will find replacement stocks for Ukraine is unclear. Ukrainian officials say both their war and the Middle East conflict show the West must dramatically increase its arms manufacturing capability, pointing to a new deal with Germany to manufacture weapons in Ukraine as something to be replicated.\\n\\nThis month has also seen Ukraine announce the arrival of long-range US ATACMS missiles with a range of around 100 miles (160 km), giving it much greater ability to strike Russian rear areas including airfields. Ukrainian officials said the first strikes – which use cluster munitions to hit a larger area – destroyed nine Russian helicopters and other equipment.\\n\\nRussia is believed to be lobbying for its own foreign arms supplies, including from China and North Korea. While the former appears to have limited its support to weapons components such as chips, a meeting between Putin and North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un in September appears to have seen the Pyongyang government opening its arsenals.\\n\\nSince August, two cargo ships have been sailing repeatedly between North Korean ports and Dunay in Russia, unloading at least 1,000 sea containers then shipped by rail to armaments bunkers at Tikhoretsk in the Caucasus.\\n\\nThe shipments were revealed last week in private satellite footage published by the London-based Royal United Services Institute. Estonian officials told reporters they believed the North Korean shipment might total around 350,000 shells, roughly the amount Russia fires each month.\\n\\nCoupled with Russia’s remaining stockpile estimated by Estonia at around four million shells, that would allow Russia to maintain its current rate of fire throughout 2024, potentially outgunning Ukraine.\\n\\nWhile some East European countries have pledged to further increase weapons shipments to Kyiv, others – including Italy and a new government in Slovakia – have said they will cut back.\\n\\nBy early 2025, the Kremlin may hope Donald Trump will be back in the White House, making good on his pre-election promises to halt support for Ukraine and make Kyiv sue for peace.\\n\\nWhether or not that happens, the coming months will bring more death and destruction, as each side works to shape the battlefield ahead of a perhaps inevitably political decision on how the conflict ends.\\n\\n* Peter Apps is a Reuters columnist writing on defense and security issues.

Many more will halt operations in the coming hours if fuel is not delivered.\\n\\nThat will put thousands of vulnerable patients at risk of dying, including 130 premature babies, 1,000 patients dependent on dialysis and those on life support machines.\\n\\n“We are on our knees asking for that sustained, scaled up, protected humanitarian operation,” said WHO regional emergencies head Rick Brennan.\\n\\nIsraeli airstrikes overnight killed more than 700 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry. That is the highest 24-hour death toll since Israel began a bombing campaign to crush Hamas in the wake of an attack by the militants two weeks ago.\\n\\nIn total, more than 5,700 Palestinians have been killed so far, including some 2,300 minors, the ministry said. The figure includes the disputed toll from an explosion at a hospital last week. Israel said it had launched 400 airstrikes over the past day, killing Hamas commanders and hitting militants as they were preparing to launch rockets into Israel.\\n\\nThere are now concerns many more will die as medical centres are forced to close. The single oncology hospital in the Gaza Strip is only partially functional due to lack of fuel, putting around 2,000 cancer patients at risk.\\n\\nThe rubble of buildings hit in Israeli air strikes in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip (AFP/Getty)\\n\\nOn Monday the private Indonesian Hospital, the biggest in northern Gaza, was forced to switch off everything except for the intensive care unit due to a critical lack of generator fuel.\\n\\nThe only other hospital that had still been serving patients in northern Gaza, Beit Hanoun Hospital, stopped operations because of the intense bombardment of the town.\\n\\nIn total, the Hamas-run health ministry said 40 medical centres had suspended operations at a time when the bombardment and displacement are putting enormous strain on the system.\\n\\nGhassan Abu Sitta, a British-Palestinian doctor who works with medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, said from the al-Shifa the situation was so dire that doctors and surgeons were having to “improvise at every level” including using washing up liquid to clean wounds.\\n\\n“The number of wounded is astronomical compared to the size of the hospital,” he told The Independent. Gaza’s largest medical complex is already at 150 per cent capacity and sheltering thousands of terrified civilians displaced by the bombings.\\n\\n“The wounded are everywhere, they are on mattresses, on the floor of the wards and in the corridors and the emergency department,” he added.\\n\\nHe said the medical team was “improvising at every level”.\\n\\n“When I have a patient I want to clean up for surgery I first wash them with washing up liquid that I bought from the corner shop then I wash them with vinegar to make sure they are antiseptic.” Only then can he use Iodine-based antiseptic materials sparingly.\\n\\nThe next problem is power as the generator fuel runs out.\\n\\n“If the electricity runs out, Shifa hospital will become a mass grave,” he added.\\n\\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres speaks during the Security Council meeting (AP)\\n\\nThe UN’s secretary general Antonio Guettes pleaded on Tuesday for civilians to be protected, voicing concern about “clear violations of international humanitarian law” in the Gaza Strip. He told the 15-member UN Security Council that at a “crucial moment like this”, it was vital to be clear that war has rules, starting with the fundamental principle of respecting and protecting civilians.\\n\\nUS president Joe Biden, when asked by reporters at the White House whether aid was getting to Gaza as fast as needed, said: “Not fast enough.” On Tuesday evening, The UN said 20 trucks that had been due to deliver aid to the besieged Gaza Strip via the Rafah crossing from Egypt on Tuesday had not entered the enclave. “We hope the materials can enter Gaza tomorrow,” UN aid spokesperson Eri Kaneko said.\\n\\nIn his speech to the UN Security Council, Mr Guterres said: “It is important to also recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation,” he added.\\n\\n“But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people,” he said.\\n\\nIsrael’s UN ambassador Gilad Erdan described Mr Guterres’ speech as “shocking”.\\n\\n“His statement that ‘the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum’ expressed an understanding for terrorism and murder,” Mr Erdan added.',\n",

However, the sponsor, ignoring the major concerns of relevant members, made only cosmetic changes to the draft before the text was put in blue in order to rush the council to vote on it, Zhang said.\\n\\n\"China is by no means opposing the council taking actions. On the contrary, we have always strongly called for the council to play a responsible role. What we oppose is that the draft resolution is evasive on the most urgent issue of ending the hostility. It has never been able to call for an immediate ceasefire in clear and unambiguous terms,\" Zhang said.\\n\\n\"If a Council resolution is ambiguous on the question of war and peace and of life and death, it is not only irresponsible but also extremely dangerous. It is tantamount to paving the way for large-scale military actions and giving the green light to further escalation of war,\" he noted.\\n\\nThe envoy underscored that China is by no means indifferent to acts that harm civilians.\\n\\n\"We strongly condemned at the first opportunity all violence and attacks against civilians, and called for diplomatic efforts to promote the early release of hostages. What we oppose is that the draft resolution does not call on the parties concerned to stop the indiscriminate and asymmetrical use of force, nor does it call for a thorough investigation into the heinous attacks such as the one on the Al-Ahli Hospital. Such selective application of international law and double standards will only push more innocent civilians to the brink of death.\"\\n\\nZhang also noted that China is by no means indifferent to the sufferings of the people in Gaza.\\n\\n\"We have always strongly called for opening humanitarian corridors, ensuring humanitarian access, and avoiding humanitarian disasters. What we oppose is that the draft resolution selectively avoids referring to the root causes of the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and fails to urge Israel to lift its full siege on Gaza and to rescind the evacuation order for northern Gaza. Such an evasive and ineffectual approach will only accelerate Gaza\\'s falling into an even greater humanitarian catastrophe.\"\\n\\nThe ambassador stressed that China is not denying Israel\\'s security concerns.\\n\\n\"We have always strongly advocated that equal attention should be paid to the security concerns and legitimate rights of both Israel and Palestine. What we oppose is that the draft resolution attempts to establish a new narrative on the Palestinian question, ignoring the fact that the Palestinian territory has been occupied for a long time and evading the fundamental issue of independent statehood for the Palestinian people.\"\\n\\nIf adopted, it will completely dash the prospect of the two-state solution and plunge the Palestinian and Israeli peoples into a vicious cycle of hatred and confrontation, the ambassador noted.\\n\\nThe ambassador pointed out that China has no selfish interests in the question of Palestine. \"Any initiative that contributes to peace will receive China\\'s staunch support. Any endeavor that facilitates Palestinian-Israeli reconciliation will be pursued by China with all-out efforts.\"\\n\\nSince the outbreak of the latest round of conflict, China has actively urged the council to take meaningful actions and make binding decisions as soon as possible, the envoy said.\\n\\n\"We also emphasize that the actions and decisions of the Council must respect facts and history, take the right direction, and show due responsibility and accountability, so as to ensure that they stand the test of morality and conscience,\" he added.\\n\\n\"We are ready to continue to work with members of the Council and the international community to play a constructive role in putting an end to the hostility, protecting civilians, averting further humanitarian catastrophes, and realizing a comprehensive, just, and lasting solution to the question of Palestine,\" the envoy said.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'October 27, 2023 12:20 am | Updated 10:05 am IST\\n\\nOn October 6, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stuck to its 6.5% GDP growth projection for the year, with risks from geopolitical tensions, economic fragmentation, volatile financial markets and an uneven monsoon, evenly balanced out by strengthening domestic demand. There was a belief that a period of heightened uncertainties was ebbing but as the central bank Governor signalled last Friday, new uncertainties have emerged over the fortnight since. The Israel-Hamas conflict that erupted a day after the monetary policy review has widened, and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has flagged worries about implications on global food, fuel and fertilizer supplies. Given India’s dependence on fuel and fertilizer imports, disruptions or price spikes could hurt the macro-economic framework, even if the government refrains from passing on higher prices to consumers and farmers in the election season. The RBI chief also pointed to rising U.S. bond yields, which hit a 16-year high of 5% this week, mixed data points and signals from central banks around the world, as the new unknowns — even as known unknowns such as financial market turmoil — have got more pronounced. A glimpse of this anxiety was visible this week, with the sharpest sell-off on Indian bourses since July.\\n\\nThere is no certainty that the RBI would still uphold its ‘evenly balanced’ outlook towards the risks to growth. However, the Finance Ministry, while acknowledging that global uncertainties have compounded, seems largely sanguine for now in its outlook for the economy. Its monthly economic review released on Monday asserts that growth “remains on track”, inflation is easing after a “temporary” seasonal surge in July-August, consumption demand is strengthening and investment demand is “also firming up”. On the “imminent fears” of rising crude oil prices, it noted that July-September quarter prices were still “way lower” than the $109.5 and $97.9 averages in the first and second quarter of 2022-23. The weak foreign trade picture is expected to recover and industrial job creation prospects are high for the next two quarters, while higher demand for housing and vehicle loans reflects bolstered confidence levels in households, it added. India’s macro fundamentals may well hold up through the latest global storm, but the government would do well to drill a little deeper into consumption and hiring trends. The last quarter has seen a sharp slump in small car sales, consumer non-durables producers reporting weak rural demand and IT firms scaling down growth and hiring hopes. There is still much to be done to correct an uneven recovery, which would eventually hamper a broader investment revival.',\n",

The group marched from 33rd and Market Streets to the Penn campus Read more\\n\\nHundreds of students at Philadelphia’s three largest universities protested in solidarity with Palestinian people in the war-torn Gaza Strip on Wednesday, criticizing the academic institutions over what they say has been a lopsided pro-Israel atmosphere since war broke out Oct. 7.\\n\\nThe rallies at Temple University, Drexel University, and the University of Pennsylvania — part of a groundswell of walkouts at campuses nationwide — come amid accelerating tensions between students, faculty, administration, and even major donors over how the academic institutions align themselves in the overseas conflict.\\n\\nWednesday’s walkout came a week after hundreds of Penn community members marched in unity with Israel, similarly criticizing the Ivy League administration over what they called an inert response to allegedly antisemitic rhetoric on campus, according to the Daily Pennsylvanian, the student newspaper.\\n\\nProtesters on both sides have shared common grievances in recent weeks — a desire for university leaders to more loudly validate their causes, and a fear over public safety for both Jewish and Palestinian students on campus.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNada Abuasi, a Drexel graduate student who has family and friends in both Palestinian territories, said university officials have not offered adequate public support to Palestinian students such as herself. Many, she said, feared that too-public expressions of solidarity could also lead to severe repercussions.\\n\\n“Folks have to censor what they say,” Abuasi told The Inquirer on Wednesday. “They have to not speak about certain things because they’re afraid of how professors will react, they’re afraid of how the administration will react — and the reason this fear exists is because they’ve seen it happen to others.”\\n\\nIn University City, Abuasi and about 200 students marched from the dragon statue at Drexel into the heart of Penn’s campus, chanting messages of support while chiding university leaders to publicly recognize the Gazans suffering in the war, which has now killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and more than 6,500 people in Gaza.\\n\\nIn North Philadelphia, about 100 Temple students, many clad in kaffiyehs that covered their mouths, gathered under the campus bell tower, leveling similar claims against university leadership.\\n\\nStudents for Justice in Palestine, which organized the Temple rally, blasted Temple president Richard Englert for his Oct. 13 statement that condemned the Hamas attack while also vowing to maintain a “diversity of thought” about the conflict on campus. Englert’s statement mentioned both “the horrific violence in Israel” and “the ongoing violence in Gaza,” but the student group said the memo offered “one-sided” sympathy for Israel.\\n\\nA petition started by the group, which had been signed more than 1,300 times as of Wednesday evening, claimed that it created a chilling effect for Palestinian students who fear that activism on campus would lead to “smear campaigns, doxing, and the distortion of [their] narratives to portray [them] as terrorists.”\\n\\nA Temple spokesperson said Englert did not plan to make an additional public statement, but shared a private email he sent to the student group responding to criticisms that his previous university-wide memos were not “emphatic enough” about the loss of life in Gaza. In the message, he told the group that the civilian death toll was “heart-wrenching” and a deep concern for the university.\\n\\n“As president of this university, it is not possible for me to reflect all the views of our Temple community,” Englert wrote to the group. “What I can do, though, is to emphasize the values that this institution holds dear, including respect for all people and the rejection of violence and terrorism in any form.”\\n\\nA Drexel spokesperson said the university is committed to “creating an environment where community members can safely engage in challenging — and even uncomfortable — conversations” and said that president John Fry had expressed “his full sympathy” to Drexel community members who have loved ones in both Israel and Gaza. Penn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nMany demonstrators at both campuses on Wednesday wore face coverings and said they would not speak publicly with the media, for fear of being targeted by university officials or losing financial aid due to the increasingly inflammatory tenor of the Israeli-Palestinian debate.\\n\\nSeveral pointed to a recent doxing incident at Harvard University, where students who signed an anonymous letter blaming Israel for the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre were later identified and accused of antisemitism, their photos publicized on a digital billboard that was driven around campus.\\n\\nToward the end of the rally on Penn’s campus, a man walked through the crowd with his cell phone, attempting to film the faces of dozens of demonstrators. He left the scene without incident after being confronted — but the interaction left many on edge and spoke to the fraught moment unfolding on campuses.\\n\\n“The surveillance, harassment, and intimidation of these young people is like no other,” said Devan Spear, a Penn alumna and activist who alleged that she had been targeted for supporting pro-Palestinian groups on campus more than a decade ago.\\n\\n“I know a lot of students and faculty are being threatened right with the loss of jobs or job possibilities,” Nour Qutyan, a Temple graduate and former leader of Students for Justice in Palestine, told the crowd in North Philadelphia. “I don’t want this to be a moment where your fear silences you.”\\n\\nTensions over the conflict had been bubbling in the months before the war. The Palestinian Writes literary festival at Penn last month erupted in controversy over the inclusion of speakers who had been accused of antisemitism. The university’s handling of the festival led to several heavyweight donors threatening to close their checkbooks, with at least one calling on university leaders to resign.\\n\\nSome demonstrators said they didn’t have high hopes over the situation at their schools. But Shane Mosley, 21, a former Drexel student who now attends the Community College of Philadelphia, said he is hopeful that students could pressure their institutions to, at the minimum, clarify their support for students who show support for people in Gaza and the West Bank.\\n\\n“I think behind the scenes, there’s a lot of turmoil, a lot of division,” he said. “If this movement keeps up, then something’s gotta give.”',\n",

Nor is he an ideological bomb-thrower like Jim Jordan, who was beloved by Donald Trump and the party’s populist right.\\n\\nInstead, Johnson was trusted by party’s right wing without the baggage that made enemies elsewhere. He has taken controversial positions – supporting a nationwide abortion ban, backing Trump’s efforts to reverse the 2020 election results and fighting against gay marriage rights – but done so quietly and, for the most part, outside the view of television cameras.\\n\\nAnd his lack of ambition from the outset, by not entering his name as a speaker candidate until the third contest, may have made him the perfect vessel for Republicans wishing to move past weeks of political trauma and given him the ability to win votes without making specific concessions or commitments.\\n\\nTo succeed as speaker, Mr Johnson is going to have to do more than that, however. Once the cheering and applause die down, the new speaker will have a busy legislative agenda to address with little time to do it.\\n\\nThe Biden administration and its allies in the Senate are pressing for a multi-billion dollar military aid bill for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. And a temporary funding measure is set to expire on 17 November, triggering a government shut-down unless Congress takes action.\\n\\nIt is during negotiations with Democrats that Johnson’s speakership will be put to the test. McCarthy’s fate was sealed when his party’s right flank felt he caved to Democrats in a May deal to raise the cap on new US national debt and when he temporarily avoided an October government shutdown without winning any new concessions.',\n",

Benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex cracked 1.4% each on Thursday to close at their lowest levels since June.\\n\\nForeign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a provisional ₹7,702.53 crore on Thursday; local institutions stepped in with purchases worth ₹6,658.45 crore, enabling the broader markets to recover from their intraday lows. With the indices falling below key levels, the investment strategy has shifted from ‘buy on dips’ to ‘sell on rise’, a market expert said.\\n\\nThe decline in benchmark indices was led by heavyweight HDFC Bank, which neared its 52-week low. During the day, the Nifty fell as low as 18,837.85 and the Sensex 63,092.98 before closing at 18,857.25 and 63,148.15.

The rollover data to ascertain whether shorts were carried forward to the November series was unavailable until press time.\\n\\nHowever, alongside cash, FPIs raised their net cumulative bearish bets on index futures (Nifty and Bank Nifty) by 59,740 contracts overnight to 152,060 contracts , a seven month high, anticipating weakness ahead.\\n\\n“Up until recently, this was a buy-on-dips market, but now it’s a sell-on-rise one,\" said Andrew Holland, chief executive of Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies. “While there hasn’t been a tearing rush for safe-haven currency or gold buying yet, uncertainty looms in the form of potentially higher crude prices if the Israel-Hamas war widens.\"\\n\\nCrude oil rose 2% to $88.1 a barrel intraday Thursday, while the rupee held steady at 83.23 against the dollar.\\n\\nHolland advised investors to “wait at the sidelines\" as any bounce could be a “dead cat one\".\\n\\nHis views were echoed by Santosh Pandey, president and head of the Nuvama professional clients group.\\n\\n“A rally toward the highs looks highly improbable in the near term, given the uncertainty over the containment of the West Asia war, which is very different from the Ukraine war, from which the market recovered within a fortnight of its onset despite its more debilitating impact on the global commodity supply chain,\" said Pandey. “Rather, we could witness more correction in broader markets, especially in stocks which have risen 2-3X in the past few months despite correcting by 10-15% from their recent highs.\"\\n\\nIT stocks appear weak, thanks to falling global spending amid higher cost of money and the likelihood of a recession in the US next year. Meanwhile, banking stocks have been hurt by lower net interest margins (NIMs) due to a repricing of deposits. HDFC Bank, whose NIMs shrank and asset quality fell quarter on quarter in September, was a notable loser, declining 2.2% to ₹1,463.40, near its 52-week low of ₹1,445.\\n\\nThe Nifty currently trades below its 100-day moving average of 19,418.09, while the Bank Nifty trades below its 200-day moving average of 43,186.93.

       " {'articleBody': 'CLAIM COVID-19 vaccines increase the risk of heart attacks more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Aseem Malhotra, The Joe Rogan Experience, 10 Oct. 2023 DETAILS Inadequate support: Apart from a heavily flawed conference abstract and an unverifiable claim from a whistleblower, no data or evidence was provided by Malhotra to support the suggestion that COVID-19 vaccines increase heart attack risk.\\n\\nCherry-picking: Several studies have already shown that COVID-19 vaccination isn’t associated with a greater risk of heart attack. No mention of these studies were made in the video. KEY TAKE AWAY Like all medical interventions, COVID-19 vaccines can produce side effects. Most of these side effects are mild and short-lived. More serious risks, such as a rare blood clotting disorder and a type of heart inflammation have also been associated with certain COVID-19 vaccines, but are rare. The risk of heart problems and blood clotting, just to name a few, is greater with COVID-19 than with the vaccines. By reducing the risk of infection and severe disease in people, the vaccines’ benefit outweighs their risk.\\n\\nFULL CLAIM: “A whistleblower from a prestigious university in the UK” said that vaccinated people had increased inflammation of the arteries of the heart which “increase heart attack risk”\\n\\nREVIEW\\n\\nA Facebook reel posted on 10 October 2023 showed British cardiologist Aseem Malhotra on the podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, claiming that “whistleblower from a prestigious university in the UK” told him people who had been vaccinated against COVID-19 had “increased inflammation of the arteries of the heart [that] wasn’t there in the unvaccinated, which again would increase heart attack risk”. He also alleged that the whistleblower had been obliged to keep these findings hidden.\\n\\nPrior to the pandemic, Malhotra was known for promoting controversial claims about the benefits of the Pioppi diet. He also claimed that statins—drugs used to reduce cholesterol levels—provide no benefit to patients with high cholesterol.\\n\\nIn September 2022, Malhotra published an article in the Journal of Insulin Resistance—a journal of which he is an editor—suggesting that COVID-19 vaccines are more harmful than helpful and that they increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.\\n\\nMalhotra’s article was panned by other scientists, who pointed out that its argument relied on cherry-picked studies with methodological flaws, anecdotal data and anonymous sources, but excluded data contradicting the article’s argument. Health Feedback wrote about the article in an earlier review.\\n\\nIn January 2023, during an interview with the BBC, Malhotra suggested that excess deaths linked to heart disease were linked to COVID-19 vaccines. This conduct was criticized by experts, and the BBC later aired an interview with physician and scientist Peter Openshaw, who pointed out that the risks of COVID-19 were greater than that posed by the vaccines.\\n\\nMalhotra’s interview with Rogan took place in April 2023, during which Malhotra proceeded to air the same views as he had done before on COVID-19 vaccines. In the run-up to his whistleblower claim, Malhotra cited a conference abstract by cardiothoracic surgeon Steven Gundry—himself a controversial figure—and news that Scotland had seen a 25% increase in heart attacks in summer 2021.\\n\\nHowever, Gundry’s abstract had actually received an Expression of Concern from the journal on 24 November 2021, a few months before Malhotra’s appearance on Rogan’s show.\\n\\nThe notice stated that “there is no data in the abstract regarding myocardial T-cell infiltration, there are no statistical analyses for significance provided, and the author is not clear that only anecdotal data was used”. In other words, no evidence was presented for the claims made in the abstract. The abstract was later corrected, removing its initial claim of “dramatically increase[d] inflammation” and clarifying that no statistical comparisons were performed.\\n\\nBecause the interview doesn’t provide any information about the whistleblower, nor does it provide a publicly available source for the alleged data showing “increased inflammation of the arteries of the heart”, we are unable to verify this claim. We reached out to Malhotra for comment and will update this review with new information if available.\\n\\nBut we can look at whether the broader claim that COVID-19 vaccines raise heart attack risk is supported by evidence so far.\\n\\nPublished studies don’t support this claim. A study performed in Israel and published in the New England Journal of Medicine didn’t find a higher risk of heart attack in vaccinated people relative to unvaccinated people[1].\\n\\nFigure 1. The relative risk of various adverse events after vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection. Adapted from the original figure by Barda et al. Note that the effects of vaccination and of SARS-CoV-2 infection were estimated with different cohorts: vaccinated people were compared with unvaccinated people, while those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were compared with uninfected people. Thus, the risks from vaccination and that of infection cannot be directly compared.\\n\\nAnother study performed in the U.S. found no association between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and heart attack[2].\\n\\nStudies performed in France also didn’t find a higher risk of heart attack in those above 75 years old[3] and in younger cohorts[4].\\n\\nA study in Hong Kong didn’t find a greater risk of heart attack in people with heart disease who’d been vaccinated against COVID-19[5].\\n\\nMoreover, COVID-19 vaccination is associated with a lower risk of developing a heart attack after SARS-CoV-2 infection, as one study in the U.S.[6] and another in South Korea reported[7]. In contrast, getting COVID-19 itself is a risk factor for developing cardiovascular problems, as studies have already reported[1,8].\\n\\nThe American Heart Association states that “People with cardiovascular risk factors, heart disease, and heart attack and stroke survivors should get vaccinated because they are at much greater risk from the virus than they are from the vaccine”.\\n\\nIn brief, numerous published studies haven’t found that COVID-19 vaccines increase the risk of a heart attack and their findings overturn Malhotra’s suggestion that there’s reason to believe otherwise.\\n\\nREAD MORE\\n\\nBritish comedian Russell Brand made a similar claim that COVID-19 vaccines caused a rise in heart attacks in young people. Health Feedback debunked the claim here.\\n\\nREFERENCES',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'The current geopolitical conflict in the Middle East due to the ongoing war between Israel and Palestinian terrorist group Hamas has brought fresh global headwinds for the Indian economy. Ever since the war broke out earlier this month, international crude oil prices have risen over 5 per cent and US bond yields have breached the 5 per cent-mark to hit 16-year high levels.\\n\\nThe economic impact of global oil supply have important implications for India – a net importer of crude oil – to deliver price stability. Analysts say that India continues to see macroeconomic stability at this moment, but is vulnerable to one key risk - supply disruption in crude oil prices because of escalation in the war, resulting in a spike in crude oil prices.\\n\\nInternational crude oil prices may rise significantly if Iran - which is a major supporter of Hamas, joins the war. If that happens, it may lead to selling pressure in the market. To explore the domestic implications better, let\\'s first understand how the Israel-Hamas war can impact the global economy:\\n\\nAlso Read: From high inflation to import bill - the domino effect of rising crude oil prices on Indian economy\\n\\nHow can the Israel-Hamas war impact the global economy?\\n\\nWith major oil producers Saudi Arabia and Russia announcing oil supply cuts of a combined 1.3 million barrels per day (mbpd) till the end of the year, the global economy already faces an oil market deficit.\\n\\nNow, with oil prices hovering above the $90 per barrel-mark, the escalation of the conflict towards other Middle Eastern oil producers is concerning and requires careful monitoring, especially given the global economy\\'s \\'higher for longer\\' interest rate scenario.\\n\\nThe oil supply is unlikely to be threatened unless the issue expands to other nations in the region and becomes a proxy conflict between the US and Iran.\\n\\n‘’Brent had crossed the $90 mark but then retreated. Now, we can use the $90 number to be the threshold beyond which there is trouble for the world economy,\\'\\' said Shantanu Bhargava, Managing Director, Head of Discretionary Investment Services, Waterfield Advisors.\\n\\nWhen oil prices rise, the cost of production for various industries and energy costs for businesses and households also surge, driving global inflation higher. High energy prices and new inflationary trends could undermine the efforts of central banks to bring inflation under control.\\n\\nWith this, central banks across the globe will continue hiking interest rates, which will slow down the global economic growth.\\n\\nThe global economy faces high inflation again as crude oil prices rise. If oil prices stay high, the US, India, China, and other major nations that import oil may see substantial import inflation. Let\\'s take a look at how the war can impact the Indian economy:\\n\\nHow can the Israel-Hamas war impact the Indian economy?\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh import bill, wider current account deficit:\\n\\nIndia - a net importer of crude oil which fulfills as much as 85 per cent of its energy needs through imports, may see a heavier import bill if international crude oil prices keep rising throughout the year. It can result in a trade deficit, as India has to spend more on oil imports, which can, in turn, put pressure on the country\\'s current account balance.\\n\\n‘’High crude oil prices hurt India impacting currency stability, possibly worsening the government’s fiscal deficit (the government is likely to absorb higher prices by cutting excise duty), widening the current account deficit (CAD) further impacting currency adversely and affecting the profit margins of sectors such as aviation, paints, tyres and chemicals,\\'\\' said Waterfields\\' Shantanu Bhargava.\\n\\nCAD is a key indicator of the balance of payment of a country and in the current scenario of the momentum picked up by crude rates, every $10 dollar rise in Brent futures potentially widens the CAD by 0.5 per cent, according to market experts.\\n\\n‘’Every 10 dollar rise in Brent crude prices widens India’s current account deficit by 0.5 per cent. Consequently this depreciates the INR and leads to imported inflation,\\'\\' said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.\\n\\n\\n\\nWeaker Indian Rupee\\n\\nHigh oil prices pushes the US dollar above against its peers, which in turn, is a downside for the Indian rupee. Since India pays for oil imports in dollars, a higher oil import bill can lead to an increase in demand for dollars, potentially weakening the rupee against the dollar.\\n\\n\\n\\nRefining Margins of OMCs:\\n\\nIf the crude oil price continues to rise, it could have a significant impact on some specific stocks and the broader economy. The Indian crude oil basket has averaged ~ $80.1 per barrel in the first five months of FY24. But the price of the Indian crude basket touched $90.7 per barrel in the first week of September.\\n\\nIf Brent crude prices remain elevated for the remainder of the fiscal year, we anticipate that the full-year average price for Indian crude oil basket could be ~$86-87 per barrel, according to estimates given by brokerages.\\n\\nHigh international oil prices will raise the average Indian crude basket price and the oil marketing companies (OMCs) including Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), will register losses in gross refinery margins.\\n\\n‘’As we approach the pre-election period, we anticipate that OMCs will absorb a significant portion of the elevated global crude prices. The government may also consider partially sharing this burden with OMCs by reducing certain duties and taxes on retail fuel prices,\\'\\' said CareEdge Ratings.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso Read: Indian crude basket to average $87/bbl, OMCs to bear the brunt as oil surges 6% over Israel-Hamas war\\n\\nInflation:\\n\\nAn increase in international oil prices may lead to higher fuel prices, which can trigger inflationary pressures. According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the sustained increase in prices is expected to lead to a lower aggregate demand as households and firms are left with less disposable incomes to spend on non-energy goods. This is how domestic consumer prices respond to an oil supply news shock.\\n\\nSurprise changes in oil prices can also influence the price and wage-setting in the economy by altering the inflation expectations of firms and households, and so, domestic economic activity falls on impact of such a shock.\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh fiscal deficit:\\n\\nThe government often subsidizes fuel prices to protect consumers from the full impact of rising oil prices. ‘’If the crude oil prices remain at their elevated level for longer, the government may need to increase subsidies or absorb a portion of the price increase, leading to a higher fiscal deficit\\'\\', according to ICICI Securities.\\n\\nIn simple words, the government bears the difference between the market price and the controlled price of oil and gas end-products such as kerosene, diesel, liquified petroleum gas (LPG). This is likely to widen the fiscal deficit - expressed as a percentage of the country\\'s gross domestic product (GDP).\\n\\n\"Exciting news!

       " {'articleBody': 'Our cohort represents a population immunized with various schemes of COVID-19 vaccines. Ninety-one percent of the cohort received a primary series of CoronaVac, combined with a first booster based on a viral-vectored (53%) or an mRNA vaccine (37%). The remaining participants (9%) received a primary series and a first homologous booster of either CoronaVac (CCC) or BNT162b2 mRNA (3mRNA) vaccines. Similar to the overall effect of a second mRNA booster dose, the scheme-specific vaccine effectiveness of these boosters remained high by the end of the follow-up, ranging from 74.2% to 86.3% effectiveness against COVID-19-related ICU admission and 79.3% to 90.8% against death. The CCA vaccination scheme plus a second mRNA booster dose provided the highest protection against COVID-19-related deaths. Our study was not designed to demonstrate the superiority of any specific vaccination scheme. However, our results suggest that mix-and-match strategies may provide comparable protection against severe disease to homologous, mRNA-based regimens.\\n\\nOur findings are consistent with previous studies on second booster doses. A recent summary of studies on mRNA vaccines25, including eight studies from Israel, one from Canada21, and one from the USA24, all conducted during the Omicron outbreak, suggests that a second mRNA booster enhances protection compared to three vaccine doses and unvaccinated individuals, particularly for severe outcomes. While not directly comparable, due to differences in study design, population characteristics, and outcome definitions, the studies in Canada21 and the USA24 estimate the vaccine effectiveness of a second mRNA booster compared to unvaccinated individuals. The study in Canada, conducted among residents in long-term care facilities aged 60 years or older, found that the effectiveness of a fourth dose against severe outcomes was 87% (95% CI 82–90)21. In the USA, research was conducted among adults aged 50 years or older without immunocompromising conditions. Those results showed that the effectiveness of a fourth mRNA dose against hospitalization was 80% (95% CI 71–85). These studies have a relatively short follow-up time of two to ten weeks after the fourth dose and thus do not fully capture immunity waning.\\n\\nAt least two other studies have examined the effectiveness of a second booster dose. A preprint study in Thailand examined the effectiveness of a second booster dose based on ChAdOx1 among adults with various three-dose background regimes, including inactivated vaccines36. The study found vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 of 73% (95%CI 48–89) but did not examine its effectiveness against severe outcomes. Using the same cohort, another study in Thailand found no severe outcomes for patients with a second booster dose based on ChAdOx1, BNT162b2, and mRNA-127326. The assessment was conducted after an average of 53 days (interquartile range: 29–75 days) following their last dose. A study in Sweden examined all-cause mortality among fourth-dose recipients of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 compared to third-dose recipients and found a decrease in short-term risk of death of about 70% among individuals older than 80 years27. Similar to our findings, the study in Sweden also found moderate waning after 2 months27. Likewise, a study in Korea31 and in Portugal32 found that a fourth mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose provided high protection against severe illness compared to a third dose in individuals older than 60 years. Last, anecdotal evidence from two participants in a cohort of healthcare workers in the USA suggests that a second homologous mRNA booster may induce a substantial and durable neutralizing antibody response37.\\n\\nOur study has some limitations. As an observational study, there is a risk of selection bias if the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups differ in a systematic way, such as risk aversion, which affects the probability of exposure to the treatment and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We adjusted our estimates with observable clinical, demographic, and socioeconomic confounders that could affect vaccination and the risk of infection, but there could be residual confounding. Second, our study design did not allow us to separate the effect of immunity waning and the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 lineages with increased immune evasion on our vaccine effectiveness estimates against severe disease for a second booster dose based on mRNA vaccines. Our work aimed to provide policymakers with estimates of vaccine effectiveness for different populations and time periods. Through a prospective monitoring system, weekly reports on the vaccine effectiveness of booster shots were provided to the Ministry of Health. Considering comparability, we made the decision to focus on overall protection levels across different populations and stages of the vaccination campaign instead of the time elapsed since the last vaccine dose. This choice was based on the understanding that vaccination campaigns are dynamic, featuring diverse intervals between doses, which poses a challenge in establishing a consistent timeframe to assess the decline of immunity. Third, COVID-19 is a notifiable disease in Chile. While RT-PCR and antigen tests are freely available for FONASA affiliates, it is possible that some individuals may have used an antigen test at home and not reported to the health system. Fourth, misclassification of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases is possible, as they are less likely to seek healthcare. Unvaccinated individuals might be less likely to seek testing for mild COVID-19, leading to an underestimation of protection against symptomatic infection, while vaccinated individuals may develop mild symptoms due to vaccine-induced protection, potentially overestimating protection against symptomatic infection. The impact of these unmeasured confounders on the estimates is uncertain; however, it is unlikely to have affected effectiveness estimates for ICU admission and death related to COVID-19. Last, the Chilean Ministry of Health has limited genomic surveillance capabilities. The ministry’s strategy has focused on detecting variants of concern through traveler and community surveillance but uses a non-probabilistic sampling strategy. Therefore, we do not have representative data to estimate the true prevalence of these variants or sub-lineages and their potential effect on vaccine effectiveness.\\n\\nOverall, our study shows that a second booster dose with mRNA vaccine had high effectiveness against severe COVID-19, independent of the COVID-19 vaccine scheme received in the past. Overall protection against COVID-19-related ICU admission and death showed a moderate decrease of about 9% and 6%, respectively, by the end of the follow-up. The introduction of the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub-lineages during the second part of the study period (Supplementary Fig. S3) and immunity waning due to a decline in the circulating levels of neutralizing antibodies as described for primary series and first booster doses may explain the decrease in protection38,39,40. We provide evidence to support mRNA-based second boosters following various background COVID-19 vaccine schemes, including widely used inactivated vaccines. These results suggest that a second booster would help minimize severe COVID-19, including deaths, and decrease the impact on the health system. The observed duration of protection for a second booster dose suggests there may be longer-acting protection after repeated immunization with both homologous and heterologous schemes and that no additional boosters are needed at six months.',\n",

The leaders of Austria and Germany went to Israel to show solidarity after the assault. Spain and Ireland often focus on the plight of the Palestinians. Hamas, for its part, is on the EU\\'s list of terrorist groups.\\n\\nThe challenge has been to strike a balance between condemning the Hamas attacks, supporting Israel\\'s right to defend itself and ensuring that the rights of civilians on both sides are protected under international law.\\n\\nEU envoys have wrangled in recent days over whether to call for a \"humanitarian pause\" or \"pauses,\" or even a \"window\" in the fighting, to allow aid in. Israel\\'s strongest backers oppose any language that might be seen to constrain its right to self-defense.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the death toll in Gaza has soared past 7,000, according to Palestinian officials. It\\'s unprecedented in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\\n\\nA draft of the leaders\\' summit statement, seen by The Associated Press, sees them call \"for continued, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid to reach those in need through all necessary measures including humanitarian corridors and pauses.\"\\n\\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said: \"I\\'m not obsessed about what language we use. What we want is the killing and the violence to stop; to stop so that humanitarian aid can get into Gaza, where Palestinian people are ... suffering, and also to allow us to get EU citizens out.\"\\n\\nHe said that about 30 Irish Palestinian citizens are stuck. \"We\\'re keen for them to be able to leave Gaza if they want to leave, and that\\'s currently not possible,\" Varadkar told reporters.\\n\\nDespite its limited political leverage, the 27-nation bloc is the world\\'s top aid supplier to the Palestinians. It has sent almost 78 million euros ($82 million) this year and over 930 million euros ($982 million) since 2000.

Aid workers and the EU say it\\'s not enough, just a tiny fraction of what came in before the war. Israel is still barring deliveries of fuel — needed to power generators — saying it believes that Hamas will take it.\\n\\nA warning by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, over waning fuel supplies has raised alarm that the humanitarian crisis could quickly worsen. Gaza\\'s population has also been running out of food, water and medicine. The EU is UNRWA\\'s third biggest funder.\\n\\nDozens of European nationals are believed to be among the more than 200 Israelis and foreigners taken hostage by Hamas.

EU officials also declined to say.\\n\\nQatar has become a key interlocutor for countries hoping to have their captive nationals released. EU officials have said that Turkey could also play an important role, underscoring the need for the bloc to maintain good relations with countries in the region, beyond Israel.\\n\\nIn the draft summit statement – perhaps due to the extreme security concerns – the leaders note only that they \"reviewed the state of play and the follow-up on the different strands of action, including concerted efforts to assist EU citizens.\"',\n",

Share your email to get all the latest politics news and headlines from Bristol Live\\n\\nA Bristol physiotherapist who volunteers for a Palestinian humanitarian organisation learned several days ago that three of her colleagues in Gaza have been confirmed dead. Earlier this week, Celia Stubbs received messages on Whatsapp from the terrified physiotherapists who now sleep in the Dar-Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza between attending to patients.\\n\\nWhile Israel has ordered the 1.1 million people living in Northern Gaza to make their way to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, many hospital workers and their patients cannot leave. Local authorities and aid groups in Gaza estimate that between 35,000 and 40,000 people are sheltering at the Shifa hospital.\\n\\nCelia, from Fishponds said that she was shocked by the conditions she encountered in the Dar-Al Shifa hospital in 2022 but is devastated by recent events: “I’ve just been crying every night thinking about the people there and when they are going to get the water and fuel supply back- It’s just horrendous, depriving innocent civilians of water and fuel.”\\n\\nREAD MORE:Family pay tribute to Bristol mum and teenage daughter killed during Hamas attack in Israel\\n\\nREAD MORE:Exactly when thunderstorms are predicted to hit Bristol\\n\\nWhile many of her fellow physiotherapists have moved into the Shifa hospital in Gaza city and are now living there with their families, one physiotherapist in her group has evacuated with his family, following the orders of the Israeli Defence Force (IDF). In the last message she received from him, he said that he was crammed in one house with around a hundred people with no access to food, water or fuel.\\n\\nCelia received an email from The Palestinian Physiotherapy Association confirming the deaths of three physiotherapists she has built a relationship with in the last year after working with them in Gaza. She currently is unable to reach any of the other colleagues in the group. Osaid Alser, a Palestinian surgeon, has been collecting the names of the healthcare workers killed in Gaza since October 7 when Israel’s bombing campaign began after Hamas killed 1,400 Israeli civilians and took around 200 hostages.\\n\\nInformation from the Palestinian Ministry of Health and local media organisations shows that as of October 18 a total of 52 healthcare workers have been killed. Following international pressure, Israel has agreed to let aid flow into Gaza from Egypt.\\n\\nIt marks a potential break in a punishing and highly controversial siege on the territory after Israel’s retaliation on Hamas saw it block access for water, food, electricity and other essential supplies to the 25-mile strip, while also carrying out air strikes. The Gaza health ministry said 3,785 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, the majority women, children and older adults.\\n\\nThe deal to get aid into Gaza through Rafah, the territory’s only crossing not controlled by Israel, remains fragile.\\n\\nCelia, who is 46-years-old and works as a university lecturer alongside her practical physiotherapy work, volunteers as part of a training programme in neonatal physiotherapy. Since her trip to Gaza in 2022 she has kept in touch with physiotherapists in the region and they have been in regular contact through a Whatsapp group where she offers training support and advice to around 20 Gazans she met when she worked alongside them in the Dar-Al-Shifa hospital.\\n\\nWhen mum-of-two Celia went to Gaza as a volunteer with Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) in 2022, her visit was postponed for a week and she had to rebook her flight due to Israeli air strikes causing a complete lockdown of Gaza. When she entered after taking a taxi from Tel Aviv airport she said that “it felt like going into a prison” but was overwhelmed by the kindness of locals who bought her presents. “They were poor but kind and welcoming,” she explained.\\n\\n(Image: Celia Stubbs)\\n\\nDespite having participated in humanitarian work for over a decade, including having witnessed the devastating impact of the earthquake in Haiti back in 2010, Celia has found the situation for the children in Gaza “the most heart-breaking.” A 15-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt since the election of Hamas has led to Gaza becoming what has been described as the biggest open air prison in the world.\\n\\nThis means that even before the most recent conflict which has seen the Israeli government cut off water, food and electricity supplies to Gaza, there were already severe shortages. Celia recalls having to use her phone as a torch to see children in the Intensive Care Unit due to constant power cuts and remembers there being a shortage of basic medicines.\\n\\nCelia said: “Now we’ve all heard about how the electricity supply has been cut off but even then the electricity supply kept being cut off. Just basic drugs that you would give children here for things like cystic fibrosis were not available there and there are certain cancer treatments that are not allowed into Gaza.\\n\\n“The situation there is awful. The people feel so repressed, they’ve got no future, they can’t leave, they can’t access the outside world. So many of the children we were seeing had mental health issues, from trauma from previous conflict.\\n\\n“They’ve all experienced bombings. There’s no opportunity, no hope and lots of fear. For me I was really upset by it and I kept in touch with a lot of the physios.\\n\\n“Up until a few days ago I was messaging my colleagues, they were all really scared - the situation was absolutely horrendous. There was no water in the hospital, no fuel and they were trying to look after all these patients who they couldn’t evacuate.\\n\\n“Now their phones have run out of battery. I have heard that three physiotherapists from our group have been confirmed dead. They are civilians and aid workers just trying to work at the hospital. For me it’s not even about taking sides, it\\'s about innocent civilians in a desperate situation.\\n\\n“A lot of my colleagues are living in the Shifa hospital in Gaza city. There are 6,000 critically ill patients who are mostly children who can\\'t move. Where are they going to go? There is nowhere in the south that can take 6,000 patients.”\\n\\n(Image: Celia Stubbs)\\n\\nThe Shifa hospital is now overflowing with people seeking shelter and was reported by The Guardian on Tuesday as being at breaking point. The evacuation order, impossible for patients and staff to follow, has been called “a death sentence” by The World Health Organisation, with Tuesday’s attack on the Al-Ahli hospital creating additional tension for the thousands stationed at the Shifa hospital.\\n\\nHuge protests erupted across the Middle East, US and Europe following the al-Ahli hospital blast, including a small vigil in Stokes Croft organised by Bristol Palestinian Solidarity Campaign on Wednesday evening. Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), the organisation Celia volunteers with, has called for a ceasefire, access for aid and an independent investigation into the recent hospital attack.\\n\\n(Image: James Manning/PA)\\n\\nIn response to the deadly strike on Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza in which more than 470 people have been reportedly killed, Melanie Ward, Chief Executive of Medical Aid for Palestinians said: \"The horrifying scenes from Al Ahli demonstrate that healthcare will not be safe until there is a comprehensive ceasefire in Gaza.\\n\\n\"The international community must urgently demand that healthcare be protected, so that that medical workers be able to care for people without fear of coming under attack.\\n\\n“A humanitarian catastrophe is happening right now in Gaza. Vital aid must be allowed immediately into Gaza, including food, fuel, water and medical relief. Evacuation orders affecting more than a million civilians and 25 hospitals must be rescinded, and civilians protected from attack wherever they are.\\n\\n“Medical Aid for Palestinians has worked with Al Ahli Hospital over many years, and we stand in solidarity with its courageous staff and demand justice for the victims. There must be a thorough, swift and independent investigation into this and all instances of attacks on healthcare in Gaza, and those responsible must be held accountable.\"\\n\\nA new campaign group called Bristol4Palestine is organising a peaceful protest for Palestine on Saturday, October 29 at 2pm from Easton Shah Jalal Mosque on Stapleton Road to College Green. Israel is currently preparing for a ground invasion into Gaza - campaigners in Bristol plan to hold a protest at 5pm at the Cascade Steps on the day this happens.\\n\\nBristol Live WhatsApp Breaking News and Top Stories Join Bristol Live’s WhatsApp community for top stories and breaking news sent directly to your phone Bristol Live is now on WhatsApp and we want you to join our community.

Mr Sunak said: \"I want to express the deep condolences from the British people and that we absolutely support Israel\\'s right to defend itself in line with international law; to go after Hamas, to take back hostages, to deter further incursions and to strengthen your security for the long-term.\\n\\n\"I know that you are taking every precaution to avoid harming civilians, in direct contrast with the terrorists of Hamas, which seek to put civilians in harms way. I also want to thank you for the support that your government has given to the families of British nationals, caught up in this conflict, including your efforts to release hostages, secure their release.\"\\n\\nMr Sunak continued by expressing his shock at the recent events, including the recent hospital attack adding that, \"we mourn the loss of every innocent life\" to which he concluded by thanking Netanyahu again for agreeing to open the border with Egypt to allow humanitarian aid to pass through before closing with the remarks: \"I\\'m proud to stand with you in Israel\\'s darkest hour, we will stand with you in solidarity, we will stand with your people and we also we want you to win.\"\\n\\nThe Prime Minister met with the Amir of Qatar in Saudi Arabia on Friday (today) before jetting off to Egypt, the third stop on his tour of the region, part of a diplomatic effort to stop the Israel-Hamas war from escalating. The British leader arrived at around lunchtime in Egypt, where he held talks with president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said the UK’s “priority” is to focus on the opening of the Rafah crossing, Gaza’s only border point not controlled by Tel Aviv, to allow humanitarian aid to enter and for British nationals to leave the bombarded territory.\\n\\nMr Sunak, in comments to Mr El-Sisi, praised Cairo’s efforts to allow movement through Rafah as he spoke about the need to ensure aid can get to Palestinians “as quickly as possible”.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'As pressure is mounting on Hamas to release the hostages including foreigners it abducted after the horrific terror on Israel on 7 October, the Islamic terror group has come up with a bizarre excuse to delay the release. A Hamas leader has said that they need time to find hostages hidden in various places in the Gaza Strip.\\n\\nA member of a Hamas delegation that visited Russia for talks claimed this while talking to Russia’s semi-official news outlet Kommersant. A Hamas official named Abu Hamid said that the group has always been willing to release civilians, but “needs time to find them.”\\n\\nAbu Hamid claimed that various groups of Hamas are holding the hostages, and a ceasefire by Israel is needed to allow Hamas to carry out a search, find the hostages, and release them. It is notable that Israel has continued with airstrikes targeting Hamas sites in Gaza, and preparing for a massive ground operation.\\n\\n“Hundreds of citizens and dozens of militants from various Palestinian factions entered the territories occupied in 1948, and after the fall of the Israeli Gaza Division, they captured dozens of people, most of them civilians, and we need time to find them in the Gaza Strip and then release them,” he said.\\n\\nHe also claimed that the Israeli bombing has killed 50 hostages so far, saying that a calm environment is needed to find the hostages and release them.\\n\\nEarlier Iran had said that Hamas is willing to release the hostages if Israel ends airstrikes on Gaza. On 16th October, the Iranian Foreign Ministry claimed that Hamas ‘potentially’ was ready to release the nearly 200 Israeli and other foreign nationals it has held hostage if Israel stops airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.\\n\\nAbu Hamid also said that in the meeting with Moscow, the Hamas delegation presented to the ‘Russian friends the reasons for the October 7 attack’.\\n\\nA group of high-ranking members of Hamas arrived in Moscow on Thursday and held talks with senior Russian officials. The Hamas delegation led by Moussa Abu Marzouk, a senior official of the group that runs the Gaza Strip, met with Mikhail Bogdanov, the Russian deputy foreign minister.\\n\\nIran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani was also in Moscow on Thursday and participated in a trilateral meeting in Moscow on October 26 with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister and Putin’s Special Envoy to the Middle East Mikhail Bogdanov, and Hamas head of international relations Mousa Abu Marzouk.\\n\\nHostages are kept in tunnels\\n\\nIt is believed that Hamas has kept the hostages in the vast network of tunnels that it has built under the Gaza Strip over decades. 85-year-old Israeli woman Yocheved Lifshitz, who was held captive and then released by Hamas on 24 October, has said that she was kept in tunnels under Gaza. She said that the Hamas tunnels are like a spider web, saying that she went through hell. She further said after entering the tunnel, they walked for hours.\\n\\nFrom her comments, it has been confirmed that most of the hostages are kept in tunnels under Gaza by Hamas. The tunnels also house rocket launchers and weapons of Hamas and provide shelter for the terrorists. As per an estimate, there are around 300 miles of tunnels under Gaza, some of which extend into Israel and Egypt. It is estimated that the tunnel network cost approximately $2 billion to build, most of which are made of pre-fab concrete structures.\\n\\nIt is said that Hamas basically has an underground city under Gaza City, comprising tunnels which are around 150 feet deep. In recent years, with the improvement in detection technology, Israel has been destroying tunnels that extend into its territory. Egypt has also blocked the Hamas tunnels that entered its territory.\\n\\nAlthough Israel has the capability to destroy deep tunnels using airstrikes, many of the tunnels are under residential areas.\\n\\nThe tunnels under Gaza make a ground invasion by Israel extremely difficult. The network of tunnels is vast, complex, almost impossible to map out and difficult to enter and exit. Experts believe that due to this reason, Hamas could be able to extend the conflict by taking time to take out hostages from the tunnel network.',\n",

On Thursday, Biden reportedly met with Muslim-American leaders at the White House in private to discuss the \"anti-Muslim attitudes.\"\\n\\nThe meeting comes in the wake of reports that the President could see his support base erode among young, progressive voters and American Muslims who feel he isn\\'t showing enough sympathy for the Palestinians.\\n\\n\\n\\nBiden came under fire on Thursday for saying that he has \"no confidence\" in the death tally from the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to media reports, Thursday\\'s meeting focused on the White House’s efforts to combat Islamophobia amid the recent incident wherein a 6-year-old Palestinian-American was stabbed to death by an American man in Chicago. Police say the child and his mother were targeted due to their religion and heritage background.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn his speech from the Oval Office on October 10, Biden made no mention of Gazans who lost their lives in the air raids, He failed to mention that Palestinians had died. Some Arab and Muslim Americans feel \"dumbfounded\" and \"disheartened\" at this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It felt like Muslim blood was cheap. All lives are not equal in the eyes of the Biden administration.

Exit polls show a clear majority of Muslims voted for Biden in 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn hotly-contested Michigan, Arab Americans account for 5% of the vote.

Biden won Michigan with 50.6% of the vote in 2020, compared to 47.8% for Trump, and Pennsylvania with 50.01% to Trump\\'s 48.84%, a difference of less than 81,000 votes.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile political analysts think Arab and Muslim Americans are unlikely to back Trump, they could decide not to vote altogether. \"I do think it will cost him Michigan,\" said Laila El-Haddad, a Maryland-based author and social activist from Gaza, told Reuters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The voters are heartbroken. They don’t want to vote for Trump. But right now they’re asking themselves, ‘How can we vote for the other side given the refusal to call upon Israel to abide by a ceasefire and the continued rhetoric that we’re seeing here domestically?\" Wa’el Alzayat, CEO of the Muslim advocacy group Emgage, told Politico. \"What I’m most concerned about is actually not whether they’re going to vote for Trump or not, but whether these voters are going to stay home.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe message has reportedly reached Biden. Mmany Democratic members of Congress have alerted the White House officials about the need to address the isolation and fear their Muslim constituents were experiencing.\\n\\n\\n\\nThings have slightly changed since then as Biden repeatedly said Hamas doesn’t represent the Palestinian people and expressed concern for Palestinian civilians. He has since pushed Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.\\n\\n',\n",

About 19 days into the conflict, the Israel Defence Forces on Tuesday announced that they were ready to \\'invade\\' Gaza, as reported by The Jerusalem Post. IDF chief-of-staff, Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi said, “I want to be clear, we are ready to invade.” Joe Biden was asked whether US was pressurising Israel to delay a ground invasion in Gaza.(AP)\\n\\n“At this stage, there are tactical and strategic factors which are allowing us more time to improve and to exploit every minute to be more ready,\" the IDF chief said confirming that the army was in the process of discussing the exact timing of the ground invasion with the country\\'s top leadership.\\n\\nIsrael-Hamas war: Latest updates\\n\\n1. The United Nations called for a ceasefire in Gaza at a high-level meeting on Tuesday. Israel rejected the call and Israel\\'s ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan said the UN secretary-general is not fit to lead the UN as he shows no understanding for the \\'campaign of mass murder of children, women and the elderly\\'.\\n\\n2. Israel’s foreign minister Eli Cohen dismissed calls for “proportionality” in the country’s response to Hamas attack and asked: “How can you agree to a cease-fire with someone who swore to kill and destroy your own existence?”\\n\\n3. A proportionate response to the October 7 attack will be a \"total destruction to the last one of the Hamas\", the foreign minister said.\\n\\n4. On Wednesday, Israel\\'s military said its jets struck Syrian army infrastructure and mortar launchers after rocket launches were made from Syria towards Israel.\\n\\n5. As the war rages on, the Israeli military said it carried out a drone strike in West Bank\\'s Jenin during clashes with armed Palestinians.\\n\\n6. On the Gaza offensive, Israel Defense Forces said some Hamas terrorists were attempting to infiltrate southern Israel via sea and were found exiting a tunnel on the Gaza coast. IDF said the tunnel was struck along with a weapons warehouse used by the terrorists in Gaza.\\n\\n7. The Israeli military has offered financial rewards to Gaza Strip residents if they share any information about hostages being held. \"If your will is to live in peace and to have a better future for your children, do the humanitarian deed immediately and share verified and valuable information about hostages being held in your area. The Israeli military assures you that it will invest maximum effort in providing security for you and your home, and you will receive a financial reward. We guarantee you complete confidentiality,\" the IDF posted.\\n\\n8. As the United Nations agency working to provide aid to Palestinian civilians said it would have to halt operations on Wednesday night as there is no fuel in Gaza, Israel\\'s military said they should ask Hamas for fuel supplies. Hamas has more than 500,000 litres of fuel in tanks inside Gaza, the IDF said making it clear that it won\\'t allow fuel in Gaza.\\n\\n9. The White House said it is developing contingency plans to evacuate Americans from the Middle East in case the Israel-Hamas war turns into a broad regional conflict. As of now, there are no active efforts to evacuate Americans from the region apart from charter flights being operated by the US.\\n\\n10.

This comes days after her sister, supermodel Gigi Hadid, also spoke about the issue. The Hadid sisters are half-Palestinians, from their father’s side.\\n\\nBella took to Instagram to write a letter addressing the conflict. She began the letter by apologising for staying silent for so long. She wrote, “Forgive me for my silence. I have yet to find the ideal words for these deeply intricate and horrific past 2 weeks, weeks that have turned the world's attention back towards a situation that has been taking innocent lives and affecting families for decades. I have much to say, but for today, I will keep it short.”\\n\\nBella Hadid: My family and I have received death threats\\n\\nThe supermodel also addressed how the issue has affected her personally, with people sending Bella and her family death threats. “I've been sent hundreds of death threats daily; my phone number has been leaked, and my family has felt to be in danger. But I cannot be silenced any longer. Fear is not an option. The people and children of Palestine, especially in Gaza, cannot afford our silence. We are not brave; they are,” she wrote.\\n\\nSympathising with the victims of the conflict, Bella wrote that her heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma that she is seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of her Palestinian blood. “Seeing the aftermath of the airstrikes in Gaza, I mourn with all the mothers who have lost children and the children who cry alone, all the lost fathers, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunties, and friends that will never again walk this earth,” she wrote.\\n\\n‘Mourning for Israeli families’\\n\\nAcknowledging the pain inflicted on the Israeli people, Bella wrote that she is mourning for the Israeli families that have been dealing with the pain and aftermath of the October 7 attacks. She also wrote that regardless of the history of the land, she condemns the terrorist attacks on civilians. She wrote, “Harming women and children and inflicting terror does not and should not do any good for the Free Palestine movement. I believe deep in my heart that no child, no person anywhere, should be taken away from their family, either temporarily or indefinitely. That goes for Israeli and Palestinian people alike.”\\n\\nBella’s family history\\n\\nSharing the history of her family in the letter, Bella wrote, “My father was born in Nazareth in the year of the Nakba (the displacement of 750,000 Palestinians in 1948). Nine days after he was born, he, in his mother's arms, along with his family, were expelled from their home in Palestine, becoming refugees away from a place they once called home. My grandparents were never allowed to return. My family witnessed 75 years of violence against Palestinian people, most notably brutal settler invasions that led to the destruction of entire communities, murder in cold blood and the forcible removal of families from their homes. The practice of settlements on Palestinian land still continues to this day. The pain of that is unimaginable.”\\n\\nBlaming the governments for these hard times, Bella said that all religions practice peace and it is governments that are corrupt.\\n\\n‘We need to keep pressure on our leaders’\\n\\nShe concluded by saying that there is an urgent humanitarian crisis in Gaza that must be addressed. “Families need access to water and food. Hospitals need fuel to power generators and tend to the wounded and keep people alive. Wars have laws - and they must be upheld, no matter what. We need to keep pressure on our leaders, wherever we are, not to forget the urgent needs of the people of Gaza, and to ensure that innocent Palestinian civilians are not the forgotten casualties of this war. I stand with humanity, knowing that peace and safety belong to us all (sic),” she wrote.\\n\\nGigi Hadid’s reaction\\n\\nEarlier, Bella’s sister, supermodel Gigi Hadid, took to her Instagram story to write about the conflict. She wrote, “There is nothing Jewish about the Israeli government’s treatment of Palestinians. Condemning the Israeli government is not antisemitic and supporting Palestinians is not supporting Hamas.”\",\n",

This is possible with a sharp rise in wild polio cases and further spread of poliovirus variant outbreaks, he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEffect of COVID-19 pandemic\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused the most persistent drop in routine immunisation in thirty years.\\n\\n“Governments must invest immediately in catch-up initiatives to reach children who were not vaccinated against polio, measles, and other common diseases during the pandemic.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPolio must be eradicated\\n\\nEradicating polio will be one of the greatest testaments to the fact that vaccines work, a milestone for the Sustainable Development Goals for health, and most importantly, a huge and historic victory for all children.\\n\\n“When we eliminate polio, it will be only the second disease in human history to be eliminated from the planet,” said UNICEF. “The first was smallpox.”\\n\\nUNICEF further confirmed that the polio virus knows no geographical boundaries. It can easily spread and paralyses children even in countries that have been polio-free for decades, as evidenced by reports of polio cases from Malawi, Mozambique, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\\n\\nThe poliovirus has no regard for national boundaries. “As long as polio exists anywhere, it will be a threat to children all over the world,” UNICEF stressed.\\n\\nThe UN humanitarian agency expressed its belief that the remaining obstacles to the elimination of polio could be overcome thereby protecting children from vaccine-preventable diseases and future pandemics.\\n\\nUNICEF therefore called on national leaders to be committed to making childhood immunisation and polio eradication a top priority for children and for the continued support of donors and partners. --Vatican News\",\n",

He called for an integrated infrastructure of data sharing, where the millions of scans and images that are used to train algorithms for medical imaging software can be shared between countries.\\n\\nUS-based radiology service provider OneImaging co-founder and CEO Elan Adler added that integration to create a more solid infrastructure is needed. He pointed to the critical data aspect of algorithm training, saying that magnetic resonance scans, for example, take much longer than other imaging techniques, meaning training AI software that supports it could take longer.\\n\\nThe sentiment is shared more widely in the industry. A 2021 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forum concluded that: “the main barriers to building a twenty-first-century healthcare system are not technical, but can be found in the institutions, processes and workflows forged long before the digital era.”\\n\\nNevertheless, the future of AI in healthcare still looks bright. A 2023 report by GlobalData predicts that global revenue for AI platforms across healthcare will reach $18.8bn by 2027 – but funding into building a digital infrastructure is essential to support its long-term growth.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'It\\'s not every interview that gets interrupted by a call from the president of the United States. But that\\'s what happened when \"Sunday Morning\" sat down with Sen. Mitt Romney and his wife, Ann. President Biden phoned Romney last week on the eve of his diplomatic mission to Israel; the Republican had just returned from his own visit, which he described as heartbreaking.\\n\\n\"Particularly to meet with the families of the hostages – their lives are entirely different,\" Romney said. \"One of the people said, \\'You don\\'t understand. We live in a different world than you do.\\'\"\\n\\nAt age 76, Mitt Romney says he still cares deeply about what is happening around the world.\\n\\nAnd here at home, he worries deeply about the future of his party.\\n\\nO\\'Donnell said, \"You were once the party\\'s nominee, and now you\\'re a pariah in the Republican Party.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, that\\'s saying it in a gentle way, yeah,\" said Romney. \"I mean, yeah, no question. I don\\'t really have a home in my party.\\n\\n\"I come from a tradition of, you know, Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush and George W. Bush and John McCain. Those are the people that have shaped our party: anti-Putin, anti-Russia, anti-authoritarians, anti-Kim Jong Un, character counts, that the character of our leaders makes a difference and it shapes the character of our country. That\\'s the party I\\'ve come from. And I don\\'t recognize that in the great majority of our party today. And that, for me, is very troubling.\"\\n\\nScribner\\n\\nThis is Romney\\'s first interview since announcing he would not seek re-election. Without having to worry about how voters will see him, he\\'s now concerned about how history views his legacy. That\\'s why he participated in a new biography by McKay Coppins, \"Romney: A Reckoning\" (published by Scribner, part of CBS\\' parent company Paramount Global).\\n\\nUpon learning that her husband was giving over his private diary to a journalist, Ann responded, \"I might\\'ve said, \\'That\\'s not a good idea! Hey, you maybe wanna look through it before and take out a few things?\\'\"\\n\\nMitt added, \"Now that I\\'ve read the book, it\\'s like, \\'Oh, did I really say that about this person? Oh, my goodness!\\'\"\\n\\nSen. Mitt Romney with his wife, Ann. CBS News\\n\\nThe book is revealing, with unvarnished opinions and stories of what happens behind closed doors in the famously clubby United States Senate. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ve heard a single member of my caucus, Republicans in the Senate, say, \\'You know, Donald Trump is great. Aren\\'t we lucky to have him as our leader?\\'\" Romney said. \"Donald Trump represents a failure of character, which is changing, I think in many respects, the psyche of our nation and the heart of our nation. And that\\'s something which takes a long time, if ever, to repair.\"\\n\\n\"In a way he almost was like a spy behind enemy lines,\" said Coppins.\\n\\nRomney gave Coppins, a staff writer for The Atlantic, hundreds of text messages and emails. The two met close to 50 times, often late at night when Romney would tell all. \"I think there was something therapeutic for him in being able to sit down and review his entire career, his life,\" Coppins said. \"This was not an authorized biography in the sense that he had any editorial control over the final product. So, there were some meetings that felt like therapy sessions. There were some meetings that felt almost confessional in nature.\"\\n\\nRomney is quoted in the book as saying, \"A very large portion of my party really doesn\\'t believe in the Constitution.\"\\n\\nHow did he come to that damning conclusion? \"When former President Trump said we should set aside the Constitution and reappoint him as president, you had Republicans cheer that,\" Romney said. \"It\\'s like, \\'Wait a second: This is the leader of our party saying we should put aside the Constitution? How can you believe you\\'re following the Constitution if that\\'s the case?\\'\"\\n\\nRomney, who barely escaped the mob on Jan. 6, 2021, was at the Capitol that day despite the concerns of his wife, Ann. \"I do get death threats,\" he said. \"And her feeling was I would not be safe and I shouldn\\'t go. And I said, \\'Well, this is a constitutional moment. This is a time when I have to be there.\\'\"\\n\\nThat day, on the Senate floor, Romney said, \"Do we weigh our own political fortunes more heavily than we weigh the strength of our republic, the strength of our democracy, and the cause of freedom?\"\\n\\nA year earlier, Romney had been the lone Republican Senator to vote to impeach then-President Trump for pressuring Ukraine\\'s president to find damaging information on political rival Joe Biden. It\\'s a stance that would have been familiar to his father, George Romney, one-time Governor of Michigan. In 1964 when Republicans nominated far-right Senator Barry Goldwater for president, George Romney took a stand against his own party. At that year\\'s nominating convention George Romney said, \"The strongest personality on Earth cannot deal with the problems of this nation except upon the basis of correct principles.\"\\n\\nO\\'Donnell asked, \"What did you learn from your dad?\"\\n\\n\"My dad is my life hero,\" Romney replied. \"As a Republican governor, he refused to endorse the nominee of his party, Barry Goldwater, for president because he thought he was weak on civil rights and extremism. So, that\\'s the person who I try and model myself after. And I\\'m not quite there.\"\\n\\nFamily remains at the center of the Romneys\\' life. They have 25 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. The senator says his wife is his closest advisor, and as we discovered in his private office, she\\'s always close at hand. \"Normally there\\'s a life-size cardboard cutout of Ann that stands right there, and they have taken it away, \\'cause they\\'re afraid you\\'d see it,\" Romney laughed. \"There it is! They gave me this and we had a good laugh about it. But then I said, \\'Don\\'t throw it away, I want to keep it!\\'\"\\n\\nSenator Romney shows Norah O\\'Donnell a stand-in for his wife. CBS News\\n\\nThe book reports on a 2019 phone call to Ann from Oprah Winfrey, alleging that Oprah said if Mitt ran for president, she would be his running mate. Ann Romney tells a different story: \"She was trying to figure out how Mitt could do an independent run. I remember trying to explain to her that that doesn\\'t work politically. I was the one that suggested, \\'Well, Oprah, why don\\'t you run with him and see how that works?\\' I don\\'t think it was really her thought at all. \\'Cause I don\\'t think she really wants to be involved in any kind of politics in an active way.\"\\n\\nAs for Mitt Romney\\'s next move, he says he cannot imagine running for president in 2024 under any circumstance: \"Perhaps if Godzilla comes in and removes all the other candidates and so forth. But other than Godzilla stepping in, no, I\\'m not running for president. Not giving it any thought.\"\\n\\nBut he is thinking about how future generations will judge his time in the public service.\\n\\nWhen asked how he wants his children to remember him, Romney said, \"Well, they probably already have an image of who I am. But my descendants I hope will walk away saying, \\'Okay, Granddad or Great-Granddad had beliefs which were either right or wrong, but he stood by \\'em.\\'\\n\\n\"I\\'d like them to also know that my life is not defined by winning and losing elections. My life is defined by my relationship with my family and my faith. That\\'s what I live for. Those other things are part of the life experience. But that\\'s the defining measure of my life.\"\\n\\nREAD AN EXCERPT: \"Romney: A Reckoning\" by McKay Coppins\\n\\n\\n\\nFor more info:\\n\\n\\n\\nStory produced by Ed Forgotson and Julie Morse.

Latest injury update from Phoenix Suns (Oct. 24)\\n\\nBy Juan Paolo David\\n\\nFollow Us Share\\n\\nKevin Durant will enter his first full season as a member of the Phoenix Suns following his acquisition at the trade deadline earlier this year. Durant was plagued by injuries last season, playing just eight regular season games in Phoenix.\\n\\nKD was healthy during the postseason, but the Suns came up short in the Western Conference semifinals against the Denver Nuggets. He remained injury-free in the offseason and played four of five preseason games. But will he be playing tonight against the Golden State Warriors?\\n\\nAccording to ESPN\\'s latest injury report, the former MVP is healthy and will be available to play in front of Warriors fans for the first time since leaving in 2019. He is expected to get a video tribute, so he\\'ll most probably receive a huge ovation from the crowd.\\n\\nUnlock Free tips from our Experts 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Get Picks Now\\n\\nHowever, the Phoenix Suns might not be without two of their three best players. While Kevin Durant is healthy and will play tonight, Bradley Beal and Devin Booker are both listed as questionable.\\n\\nBeal is reportedly dealing with lower back tightness, while Booker has a sore left big toe. Both injuries are minor, so there\\'s a chance the Suns\\' \"Big 3\" will be complete against the Golden State Warriors.\\n\\nThe only Suns player out against Golden State is Damion Lee, who is a former Warriors player and the brother-in-law of Steph Curry. Lee is recovering from knee surgery to repair a torn right meniscus. There\\'s currently no timetable for his return.\\n\\nExpand Tweet\\n\\nAlso Read: Tristan Thompson owes ex-Jordan Craig $224K in child support just weeks after being hailed as great dad by Kim Kardashian\\n\\nKevin Durant excited to play in front of Warriors fans again\\n\\nKevin Durant of the Phoenix Suns\\n\\nKevin Durant had three great seasons with the Golden State Warriors from 2016 to 2019, winning two NBA championships in three trips to the NBA Finals. Durant suffered a torn Achilles in his final game in a Warriors uniform, leaving Golden State for the Brooklyn Nets in the summer of 2019.\\n\\nHowever, Durant\\'s tenure with the Nets was a disaster. He played just 129 games in three and a half seasons in Brooklyn filled with injuries and team turmoil. He failed to play in front of Warriors fans during his entire time with the Nets.\\n\\nThat all changes on opening night when he faces his former team for the first time since 2019. He told reporters in a recent media availability that his relationship with Warriors fans is special and he\\'s looking forward to tonight\\'s game.\\n\\n\"Some incredible moments there,\" Durant said. \"We have built a bond that don\\'t really have to be spoken about. … I feel like they\\'ve been supporting me well before I came there, actually. And then once I became part of the Warriors, they just went even harder in support of me, myself and my teammates. Every player individually felt what it was like to play for the Golden State Warriors.\"\\n\\nAlso Read: \"Everyone was in the Bahamas\" - Lil Baby once lost $600,000 with James Harden, Drake and Meek Mill',\n",

Any errors or discrepancies in these reports can severely impact an individual’s borrowing capability and cost of credit. Therefore, the swift and effective resolution of complaints lodged against such discrepancies is crucial.\\n\\nVineet Tyagi, Head of India Operations and Global CTO, Biz2Credit and Biz2X, says, “These changes mark a significant stride in bolstering customer protection and satisfaction. The mandate for credit information companies (CICs) to compensate for delays in credit data updates not only encourages operational efficiency but also yields several advantages for consumers.

It encourages them to improve their internal dispute-resolution mechanisms and also helps in fostering increased transparency.\\n\\nTyagi says, \"The regulations enhance transparency and trust in the credit reporting process. Furthermore, customers gain the means to hold CICs accountable for inaccuracies, ensuring their rights are safeguarded. These rule changes collectively contribute to a fairer, more customer-centric credit information landscape, benefitting both consumers and the industry at large.”',\n",

It\\'s very serious, and it demands an explanation.\\n\\n\"I want to answer the biggest question that\\'s probably on your mind: Is Hasan Minhaj secretly a psycho? Underneath all that pomp, is Hasan Minhaj just a con artist who uses fake racism and Islamophobia to advance his career? Because after reading that article, I would also think that.\"\\n\\nThe New Yorker story alleges that Minhaj embellishes stories and is selective in the information he presents, creating routines based on \"emotional truth\" to make points about racism in America.\\n\\nHasan Minhaj says he made \\'artistic choices\\' in standup, New Yorker responds\\n\\nMinhaj explains that he took \"a beat\" to respond to the article, to process what\\'s happening in the Middle East with the Israeli-Hamas attacks and all of the criticism he faced after the article\\'s publication.\\n\\n\"I just want to say to anyone who felt betrayed or hurt by my standup, I am sorry,\" the \"Homecoming King\" comedian says in the video. \"I made artistic choices to express myself and drive home larger issues affecting me and my community, and I feel horrible that I let people down.\\n\\n\"And the reason I feel horrible is because I\\'m not a psycho. But this New Yorker article definitely made me look like one. It was so needlessly misleading,\" he continues. \"Not just about my standup, but also about me as a person. Truth is, racism, FBI surveillance and the threats to my family happened. And I said this on the record.\"\\n\\nThe fallout extended beyond fan commentary online: Minhaj was poised to take over as host of Comedy Central\\'s \"The Daily Show\" before the article\\'s publication. The show has since resumed guest hosts in search of a permanent anchor.\\n\\nIn response to Minhaj\\'s video, The New Yorker said in a statement to USA TODAY Thursday: \"Hasan Minhaj confirms in this video that he selectively presents information and embellishes to make a point: exactly what we reported. Our piece, which includes Minhaj\\'s perspective at length, was carefully reported and fact-checked.\\n\\n\"It is based on interviews with more than 20 people, including former \\'Patriot Act\\' and \\'Daily Show\\' staffers; members of Minhaj\\'s security team; and people who have been the subject of his standup work, including the former F.B.I. informant \\'Brother Eric\\' and the woman at the center of his prom-rejection story. We stand by our story.\"\\n\\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Minhaj\\'s rep for comment.\\n\\nHasan Minhaj explains racism stories in Netflix specials\\n\\nIn his Netflix special \"Homecoming King,\" Minhaj tells the story of a white girl, whom he gives the fake name \"Bethany Reed,\" that he says he asked to prom, but who rejected him because her family didn\\'t want their daughter in photos with \"a brown boy.\"\\n\\n\"Bethany\\'s mom really did say that – it was just a few days before prom,\" he says in the video, showing emails and texts with Bethany he claims the New Yorker ignored.\\n\\nThe emails Minhaj shows indirectly reference the prom rejection, with Bethany thanking Minhaj for \"protecting\" her family and noting her parents have come \"a long way.\"\\n\\n\"I created the doorstep scene to drop the audience into the feeling of that moment, which I told the reporter,\" he says in the video before playing an audio clip of part of his conversation with the article\\'s writer, Clare Malone, about the scene.\\n\\nHasan Minhajaddresses his \\'unhinged\\' \\'Celebrity Jeopardy!\\' appearance: \\'Fans hate my guts\\'\\n\\nAddressing the other stories from his standup, Minhaj admitted both in the article and the video that he embellished stories about being harassed by law enforcement surveilling the mosque his family attended and taking his daughter to the hospital after she was exposed to what was thought to be anthrax in a letter sent to their home.\\n\\n\"I thought I had two different expectations built into my work: my work as a storytelling comedian and my work as a political comedian, where facts always come first,\" he says in the video. \"That is why the fact-checking on (Minhaj\\'s Netflix comedy talk show) \\'Patriot Act\\' was extremely rigorous. But in my work as a storytelling comedian, I assumed the lines between truth and fiction were allowed to be a bit more blurry. And I totally get why a journalist would be interested in where that line sits.\\n\\n\"The guy in this article is a proper … psycho, but I now hope you feel like the real me is not,\" Minhaj ends the video. \"Again, there is much more important news happening in the world right now that needs your attention.

However, differences in performance may have underlying clinical reasons and may not necessarily indicate unfairness,\" explained first author Ms Liu Mingxuan, a Ph.D. candidate in the Quantitative Biology and Medicine (Biostatistics & Health Data Science) Program and Center for Quantitative Medicine (CQM) at Duke-NUS.\\n\\n\"Focusing on equity—that is, recognizing factors like race, gender, etc., and adjusting the AI algorithm or its application to make sure more vulnerable groups get the care they need—rather than complete equality, is likely a more reasonable approach for clinical AI,\" said Dr. Ning Yilin, Research Fellow with CQM and a co-first-author of the paper.\\n\\n\"Patient preferences and prognosis are also crucial considerations, as equal treatment does not always mean fair treatment. An example of this is age, which frequently factors into treatment decisions and outcomes.\"\\n\\nThe paper highlights key misalignments between AI fairness research and clinical needs. \"Various metrics exist to measure model fairness, but choosing suitable ones for health care is difficult as they can conflict. Trade-offs are often inevitable,\" said Associate Professor Liu Nan also from Duke-NUS\\' CQM, senior and corresponding author of the paper.\\n\\nHe added, \"Differences detected between groups are frequently treated as biases to be mitigated in AI research. However, in the medical context, we must discern between meaningful differences and true biases requiring correction.\"\\n\\nThe authors emphasize the need to evaluate which attributes are considered \\'sensitive\\' for each application. They say that actively engaging clinicians is vital for developing useful and fair AI models.\\n\\n\"Variables like race and ethnicity need careful handling as they may represent systemic biases or biological differences,\" said Assoc Prof Liu. \"Clinicians can provide context, determine if differences are justified, and guide models towards equitable decisions.\"\\n\\nOverall, the authors argue that pursuing fair AI for health care requires collaboration between experts in AI, medicine, ethics and beyond.\\n\\n\"Achieving fairness in the use of AI in health care is an important but highly complex issue. Despite extensive developments in fair AI methodologies, it remains challenging to translate them into actual clinical practice due to the nature of health care—which involves biological, ethical and social considerations,\" said co-author Associate Professor Daniel Ting, Director of SingHealth\\'s AI Office and Associate Professor from the SingHealth Duke-NUS Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences Academic Clinical Program.\\n\\n\"In order to advance AI practices to benefit patient care, clinicians, AI and industry experts need to work together and take active steps towards addressing fairness in AI.\" Ting is also Senior Consultant at the Singapore National Eye Center and Head of AI & Digital Innovation at the Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI).\\n\\n\"This paper highlights the complexities of translating AI fairness techniques into ethical clinical applications. It represents our collective commitment to developing AI that augments clinicians with trustworthy insights to provide quality and equitable care enhanced by technology,\" said co-author Clinical Associate Professor Lionel Cheng Tim-Ee, Chief Data & Digital Officer, Clinical Director (AI) Future Health System Department, and Senior Consultant, Department of Diagnostic Radiology at Singapore General Hospital (SGH).\\n\\n\"Clinicians must be actively engaged in iterative communication with AI developers to ensure models align with medical ethics and context,\" added senior co-author Professor Marcus Ong, Director of the Health Services & Systems Research (HSSR) Program at Duke-NUS, who is also Senior Consultant at SGH\\'s Department of Emergency Medicine.\\n\\n\"Good intentions alone cannot guarantee fair AI unless we have collective oversight from diverse experts, considering all social and ethical nuances. Pursuing equitable and unbiased AI to improve health care will require open, cross-disciplinary dialogues.\"\\n\\nThe perspective published in npj Digital Medicine represents an international collaboration between researchers from institutions across Singapore, Belgium, and the United States.\\n\\nAuthors from across the SingHealth Duke-NUS Academic Medical Center (including Duke-NUS, SingHealth, SGH, Singapore Eye Research Institute and Singapore National Eye Center) worked together with experts from the University of Antwerp in Belgium as well as Weill Cornell Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the United States.\\n\\nProfessor Patrick Tan, Senior Vice-Dean for Research at Duke-NUS, commented, \"This global cooperation exemplifies the cross-disciplinary dialogues required to advance fair AI techniques for enhancing health care.

Among those facing the dire sentence is Commander Sugunakar Pakala (retd). The verdict, shrouded in uncertainty and allegations, has ignited a wave of anguish among the families of the accused, as they grapple with the distressing turn of events.\\n\\nKalyan Chakraborty, the brother-in-law of former Navy Commander Sugunakar Pakala, shared his profound sorrow upon hearing the verdict from Qatar. Speaking to Republic in a telephonic conversation, Chakraborty remarked, \"First thing is without proving what fault they have done, this is very injustice. From last 14 months all 8 naval officers\\' families have been suffering. They are trying to punish all innocent officers, in which one is a presidential awardee.\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nExpressing his bewilderment at the sudden change in the narrative surrounding the case, Chakraborty questioned, \"Yesterday, they changed the scenario, claiming that these individuals were attempting to spy for Israel. Why would an Indian national engage in espionage on behalf of another country?\"\\n\\n\"These are all respectable naval ex-naval officers. They all have been awarded,\" he said.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\'Bina Jija ji ke mere behen aur bacche kya karenge?\\'\\n\\nWhen asked about the assistance provided by the Indian government, Chakraborty affirmed, \"Yes, our govt is with us from day one. They are helping us out in all ways but the problem is Qatar govt is not giving any evidence that these men have done these faults. Without giving a proper statement, you cannot punish anybody. And sending to death is something of very shocking news.\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhen asked whether the family got any consular and legal assistance so far in connection with the case, he said, \"The embassy is with us, the govt is with us.\"\\n\\nHe also revealed the distressing condition of Commander Pakala\\'s wife, stating, \"My sister is in shock and her health is completely down from yesterday. Seeing her health, we all are literally… matlab aisa lagta hai ki hume bhi le ja kar wahi dafna dein to accha hai. Bina Jija ji ke mere behen aur bacche kya karenge? (It feels as if taking all of us and burying us alongside him would be preferable. Without my brother-in-law, what will my sister and her children do?)\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn a heartfelt plea to the Indian government, Chakraborty implored, \"I request the Indian government, please get back our eight naval officers with pride.\\n\\n‘We stand with the Govt on this…’: Coursemate and colleague of Commodore BK Verma\\n\\nRepublic TV also spoke to the coursemate and colleague of Commodore BK Verma. He said, Commodore BK Verma is a NDA cadet. He has been a forthright officer whose integrity was impeccable. His Espionage has come as a shock. The present verdict is disturbing and one hopes that our country will be able to do something about it.”\\n\\nSupporting the Indian government he said, “We will rally behind our country irrespective of the fact that we are serving or retired. We stand behind Indian Government on this. We were given assurance by Indian Navy that they will make sure that Commander Birender K Verma and other eight colleagues will be released soon.\\'\\'\\n\\nTalking about the personal help to Commander Verma, his coursemate said, “In Indian Defence forces, many children do not see their father as they serve in forward areas. In such cases, their colleagues come forward to help. Kudos to Commander Verma who took a brave step as a mother to get his daughter married while her husband was in jail in Qatar. We as coursemates helped her in these tough times.”\\n\\nRetd Commander Punendu Tiwari\\'s sister speaks to Republic\\n\\nMeetu Bhargawa, the sister of retired commander Punendu Tiwari, who has also been granted the death sentence, urged the government of India, “I plead with the MEA, the honourable Prime Minister, the government of India to act fast and bring back all eight veterans to India.”\\n\\nNotably, the 8 Indian nationals, who were employed by the private security company Al Dahra, were detained in August of the previous year, reportedly in connection with an alleged espionage case. However, neither the Qatari authorities nor the Indian government have disclosed the precise charges brought against the Indian nationals, intensifying the agony of their families. The eight Indian nations are-- Captain Navtej Singh Gill, Captain Saurabh Vashisht, Commander Purenendu Tiwari, Captain Birendra Kumar Verma, Commander Sugunakar Pakala, Commander Sanjeev Gupta, Commander Amit Nagpal and Sailor Rajesh.',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Dr Fadel Naim, head of the orthopaedic department in Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, had just finished a surgery on the evening of October 17 when he heard the “sound of two rockets” closing in. The false ceiling in the operation theatre collapsed. Though he sustained an injury on his head, Naim managed to run out.\\n\\n“When I came out in the courtyard, it was full of body parts,” Naim told Scroll on a phone call from Gaza city. “…Dead people, injured people. We tried to help as many as we could.”\\n\\nThe explosion at the 41-year-old hospital in south of Gaza city killed between 300 and 500 people –patients, medical staff and displaced people who had taken shelther there.\\n\\n“This was a big massacre,” Naim said. “Hundreds of people were thrown away.”\\n\\nThe source of attack on Al-Ahli Arab hospital remains contested. Authorities in Gaza have blamed Israel but Tel Aviv claims it was the result of a misfired rocket by Hamas.\\n\\nThough hospitals and schools are counted as protected civilian establishments under international humanitarian law, data from the World Health Organisation shows that at least 51 health facilities have been attacked since Israel began its war on Gaza on October 7.\\n\\nAccording to the Gaza health ministry, 49 medical staff have died in the conflict, 70 have injured and 23 ambulances have been damaged.\\n\\nSince the beginning of the conflict, 4,137 people have died in Gaza and over 13,612 have been injured.\\n\\nAs the war on Gaza enters its third week, international agencies are calling attention to the precarious situation in territory’s hospitals. They are vulnerable to attack from Israeli forces, who claim that hospitals in Gaza are being used as shelters by Hamas militants. They are also running very low on supplies, putting the lives of thousands of civilians at risk.\\n\\nDr Fadel Naim, orthopaedic surgeon in Al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza. Photo by Special Arrangement\\n\\nOver the last week, international humanitarian law has been repeatedly breached in Gaza, said Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organisation’s Health Emergencies Programme during a press briefing. “And it has to stop,” he said. “It must stop. Any attack on health workers in this situation is a violation of international law.”\\n\\nOn Saturday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society that runs the Al-Quds hospital in Tel al-Hawa area, said it had received a warning from Israeli forces to evacuate the establishment. The hospital has 400 patients and said it is providing shelter to 12,000 people who have been displaced. “My anaesthetist friend in Al-Quds said they have over 100 wounded patients,” said Dr Mads Gilbert, a Norwegian anaesthesiologist who has visited Gaza four times since 2006 to treat people during conflict situations. “They have refused to evacuate.”\\n\\nIn 2015, Israel barred him for life from entering Gaza. Gilbert has been waiting in the Egyptian capital of Cairo for 10 days for the Rafah border passage to open so that his team can treat those wounded in Gaza. The Rafah crossing connects the Gaza Strip with Egypt.\\n\\nRyan of the WHO said those undergoing treatment in Gaza’s hospitals were in an extremely vulnerable state. Some were on incubators. Others were undergoing complicated operations and amputations. Some had head injuries or multiple fractures. “We cannot move these patients from hospital,” Ryan said. “Moving hundreds and thousands of these patients is a death sentence to those patients as well.”\\n\\nAl-Ahli Arab hospital, the site of the explosion, was one of the 22 hospitals in the north of Gaza Strip that was given an evacuation order by the Israeli military on October 12, said Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean.\\n\\n“The order for evacuation has been impossible to carry out given the current insecurity, critical condition of many patients and lack of ambulances, staff, health system bed capacity,” Al-Mandhari said during a WHO press briefing.\\n\\nThe WHO has urged Israel to reverse its evacuation orders. The United Nations has made a similar appeal. “Hospitals are sacrosanct, and they must be protected at all cost,” said Volker Türk, the UN High Commissioner.\\n\\nThis is AL-Quds #Hospital that is facing threats of bombardment and demands for the evacuation of 12,000 citizens who sought refuge in this place for safety.#NotATarget #Gaza_under_attack_now pic.twitter.com/jCbV9dVObP — PRCS (@PalestineRCS) October 20, 2023\\n\\nThough the Al-Ahli hospital has been evacuated since the explosion, efforts to resume operations are underway. Naim said he hoped patients would be admitted again by Saturday. “If we leave the hospital, we could be killed anywhere,” he said. “So we will continue to treat patients till the end of the war.”\\n\\nBut to restart, Al-Ahli hospital needs medical supplies. “We are out of fuel, water, food and medical supplies,” Naim told Scroll. He has operated on at least 100 patients since the conflict started.\\n\\nThe facility is in dire need of antibiotics and surgical equipment. “Our’s is a small hospital,” he said. “We are getting many cases of fractures, specially open fractures with soft tissue defect. We need to transfer some patients to Egypt. We cannot deal with such load.”\\n\\nIn Al-Shifa hospital, the largest medical facility in Gaza city, doctors need surgical disposable material to dress the wounds of the injured. Patients from Al-Ahli hospital were transferred here after the explosion.\\n\\nGilbert told Scroll from Cairo that the Gaza health authorities said that they need disposable material, bandages, essential drugs, medication, external fixators to fix fracture, sutures for children, anaesthesia drug, antibiotics, IV fluid, in particular for children.\\n\\n“When doctors don’t have the tools, how can they operate?” Gilbert said. “This blockade is not only suffocating 2.2 million civilians, among them one million children, it is also completely stopping the functioning of health care system.”\\n\\nAt a webinar on Friday, Dr Amber Allayan, the deputy cell manager in the Middle East of Médecins Sans Frontières said that the organisation has emptied its stocks to help the Gaza health ministry. MSF has 300 staffers in several hospitals in the Gaza Strip. “We can’t refill our stock,” she said. “We can’t get” supplies in.\\n\\nFarhat Mantoo, Executive Director for MSF South Asia, told Scroll by an e-mail that their team has exhausted three weeks’ worth of medicine stock in three days. “In Al-Shifa Hospital, the very few remaining members of our team reported a shortage in painkillers,” Mantoo said. “They heard wounded patients screaming in pain.”\\n\\nNaim said seven hospitals in Gaza city are currently not functioning, while about 15 are working only partially.\\n\\nDr Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO Representative in the Occupied Territories, said 34 hospitals across the Gaza Strip are not operating because of severe damage. About 60% of primary health centres are shut. “Blood banks have only one week of supply,” Peeperkorn said. “Those that are functional are fast running out of supplies too,” he said during a press brief.\\n\\nHe added that patients with diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and those who need obstetrics care are unable to access treatment. Water and sanitation remain a major concern. The Gaza Strip has about 10,000 pregnant women, of them nearly 3,000 are in their last trimester and in need of delivery care, Dr Gilbert said.\\n\\nDr Richard Brennan, the regional emergency director in WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean regional office, said during a press brief that medical supplies and equipment have been held up for days as the Rafah border crossing remains closed.\\n\\n“We’re ready to go as soon as there is an opening,” Brennan said. “But it is extremely frustrating.”\\n\\nA group of doctors from Jordon wait in Cairo to enter Gaza. Photo by Special Arrangement\\n\\nOver-burdened health facilities\\n\\nDr Mohammed Ghuneim, an emergency medicine doctor in Al-Shifa hospital, told Scroll about the challenges he and his colleagues were facing. “We have been trained in mass casualty,” he said. “But no guidelines in the world can prepare us for this.”\\n\\nAs the largest hospital in north Gaza, Al-Shifa hospital is receiving patients from nearby areas and hospitals. “We have received more than 700 casualties at the same time in over 25 minutes,” Ghuneim said. “There is no space. We are dealing with patients on the floor, there are no beds.”\\n\\nThe war is taking a toll on the health workers. Ghuneim has not gone home for 14 days. “We are sleeping for short periods,” he said. “There is not a lot of food available, we are eating sparingly.”\\n\\nThere are also fears of Israeli attacks. “I don’t think our hospital is safe either, not after bombardment in Al-Ahli,” he said.\\n\\nHe has lost several loved ones over the last fortnight. His medical school teacher, Dr Omar Ferwana, arrived in a gunny bag for him to identify. “His entire family has been wiped out,” Ghuneim said. “There was no one to identify him.”\\n\\nNext to Dr Ferwana’s body, Ghuneim had to also identify his daughter Dr Aya Ferwana, who worked in the family medicine department. “These are the tragic stories we all witnessing,” he said. “We can never forget them.”',\n",

This is possible with a sharp rise in wild polio cases and further spread of poliovirus variant outbreaks, he said.\\n\\nUNICEF logo\\n\\nEffect of COVID-19 pandemic\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused the most persistent drop in routine immunisation in thirty years.\\n\\n“Governments must invest immediately in catch-up initiatives to reach children who were not vaccinated against polio, measles, and other common diseases during the pandemic.”\\n\\nPolio must be eradicated\\n\\nEradicating polio will be one of the greatest testaments to the fact that vaccines work, a milestone for the Sustainable Development Goals for health, and most importantly, a huge and historic victory for all children.\\n\\n“When we eliminate polio, it will be only the second disease in human history to be eliminated from the planet,” said UNICEF. “The first was smallpox.”\\n\\nUNICEF further confirmed that the polio virus knows no geographical boundaries. It can easily spread and paralyses children even in countries that have been polio-free for decades, as evidenced by reports of polio cases from Malawi, Mozambique, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\\n\\nThe poliovirus has no regard for national boundaries. “As long as polio exists anywhere, it will be a threat to children all over the world,” UNICEF stressed.\\n\\nThe UN humanitarian agency expressed its belief that the remaining obstacles to the elimination of polio could be overcome thereby protecting children from vaccine-preventable diseases and future pandemics.\\n\\nUNICEF therefore called on national leaders to be committed to making childhood immunisation and polio eradication a top priority for children and for the continued support of donors and partners.\",\n",

But what’s been happening lately cannot be sugarcoated.\\n\\nThis is a scary new paradigm in the tropics. And we all need to worry.\\n\\nHurricane Otis struck very near Acapulco, Mexico, on Tuesday night as a monster 165 mile-per-hour category 5 cyclone. On Monday night, about 24-hours prior to landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) was predicting it would do so as 70 mile-per-hour tropical storm.\\n\\nWith the energy content (and destructive potential) of the wind increasing with the cube of the windspeed, that means that Otis reached Mexico with 13 times more destructive potential than what had been called for! Even when the tardy hurricane warning was issued at 4 a.m. local time on Tuesday, NHC was still forecasting just an ordinary category 1 hurricane to reach Mexico’s Pacific coast.\\n\\nGet South Florida local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.\\n\\nI want to be clear that this is not an article about NHC’s skill. The collection of experts at their offices in Miami is the best in the hemisphere at analyzing and forecasting tropical cyclones. I’ve written about how they were once hesitant to forecast rapid intensification of hurricanes but have adjusted do so more often‚ like they correctly did for hurricanes Idalia and Lee in the Atlantic this year.\\n\\nIn the case of Otis, NHC first noted in their Sunday advisories that the waters were \"very warm.\" Rapid intensification was first contemplated late on Monday night based on the low-level structure of the tropical storm at the time. On Tuesday morning NHC indicated that models showed a 1-in-4 chance of Otis undergoing rapid intensification (RI), and by midday the chance of RI was characterized as \"greater than normal.\" But RI was never explicitly called for.\\n\\nSATELLITE SPOTLIGHT: @NOAA\\'s #GOES18 🛰️ caught an incredible display of eye wall #lightning as Hurricane #Otis rapidly strengthened yesterday evening. According to @NHC_Atlantic, Otis was the strongest Eastern Pacific hurricane to make landfall in the satellite era. #Acapulco pic.twitter.com/auThP6ueUO — NOAA Satellites - Public Affairs (@NOAASatellitePA) October 25, 2023\\n\\nOtis then proceeded to go from a 50 mph low-end tropical storm at 11 p.m. on Monday night to a 160 mph category 5 hurricane 24 hours later. Just on Tuesday afternoon, Otis grew from a tropical storm into a category 3 hurricane in the span of six hours! Otis\\' level of rapid intensification broke Hurricane Patricia’s record in 2015 for fastest-strengthening hurricane in a span of 12 hours eastern Pacific.\\n\\nNOAA Hurricane Otis at 5 p.m. on Oct. 24, 2023.\\n\\nWhile Otis is a record-setter, this is far from the first time the eastern Pacific has seen rapidly intensifying hurricanes this year. A whopping 80% of this year’s storms have undergone rapid intensification. Norma did it just before Otis, and Lidia earlier this month went from 80 to 140 mph in just 18 hours. Jova, in September, went from 70 to 155 mph in a day.\\n\\nThe Atlantic, which has faced El Niño-produced wind shear often, still has had three hurricanes undergo RI in 2023: Franklin, Idalia (which struck Florida), and Lee, which reached the once-rare category 5 intensity. In the western Pacific, nearly half of all storms underwent RI.\\n\\nFor those of you that follow developments in climate science, you’ve known that for many years the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had been predicting that tropical cyclone intensities would increase in a warming climate. Confidence in that forecast has gone from medium to high over the years. And while the total number of tropical storms around the globe has remained steady, the proportion of those reaching category 4 & 5 intensity had indeed gone up.\\n\\nWhich leads to my warning.\\n\\nI am supremely confident forecasting hurricane tracks. If it’s not coming, it’s not coming! But I am no longer as comfortable in putting everyone at ease in regard to the strength of a storm. My confidence in forecasting storm intensity is decreasing.\\n\\nIn the battle of wind shear versus hot sea surface temperatures, it seems like the warm water is winning most of the time. Otis had wind shear over it, and it didn’t matter.\\n\\nOne of these days, in the not too distant future, there’s going to be a run-of-the-mill tropical storm in the central Bahamas that’s going to ramp up to category 4 or 5 intensity before reaching Miami. Will NHC or I be able to correctly call for such rapid intensification?\\n\\nIf they can miss it, so can I.\\n\\nAll that to say that we are in a new era, one in which climate change, through the physical changes it’s producing in the ocean and atmosphere, is boosting windspeeds and rainfall in hurricanes. The insurers and reinsurers see it, and it’s reflected in their premiums. The military sees it, and it’s reflected in the actions they’re taking to retrofit bases and prepare for climate-driven crises. And 3 in 4 Americans see it, and it’s manifesting in how the climate crisis is ticking up in the rankings of the most important voter priorities.\\n\\nThis hurricane season will be over in a month or so, and obviously we’ll be watchful. But I want you to think of future hurricane seasons and this scary new paradigm. There are limits to resiliency, but preparedness has never been more important.\\n\\nFuture hurricanes are more likely than ever to be worse than any you’ve ever experienced.\\n\\nJohn Morales is NBC6\\'s hurricane specialist.',\n",

There is no indication that the disappearances of Qin and Li signal a change in China’s foreign or defense policies, although they have raised questions about the resilience of president and ruling Communist Party leader Xi Jinping’s circle of power.\\n\\nXi has a reputation for valuing loyalty above all and has relentlessly attacked corruption in public and private, sometimes in what has been seen as a method of eliminating political rivals and shoring up his political position amid a deteriorating economy and rising tensions with U.S. over trade, technology and Taiwan.\\n\\nLi is under U.S. sanctions related to his overseeing weapon purchases from Russia that bar him from entering the country. China has since cut off contacts with the U.S. military, mainly in protest over U.S. arm sales to Taiwan, but also strongly implying that Washington must lift the measures against Li, which Beijing refuses to publicly recognize.\\n\\nThe announcement from state broadcaster CCTV said that both Li and Qin had been removed from the State Council, China’s Cabinet and the center of government power. That virtually assures the end of their political careers, although it remains unclear whether they will face prosecution or other legal sanctions.\\n\\nCCTV also announced Lan Fo’an’s new appointment as finance minister, and Yin He’jun as science and technology minister.\\n\\nChina’s political and legal systems remain highly opaque, fueling lively discussion of possible corruption, personal foibles or fallings-out with other powerful figures leading to the downfall of top officials.\\n\\nAlong with dealing with what appear to be internal political issues, the ruling party is struggling to revive an economy that has been severely impacted by the draconian “zero-Covid” measures, an aging population, high unemployment among college graduates and a movement of many of its wealthiest and best educated to more liberal societies abroad.\\n\\nHaving had his ideology, known as “Xi Jinping Thought,” enshrined in the party constitution and with the abolishment of presidential term limits, Xi has structured the system so that he may stay in power for the rest of his life.

       " {'articleBody': \"ONE OF THE many questions that people still have about the Covid-19 vaccines is how they affect the heart.\\n\\nWe know the effects of Covid itself on that organ. In the opening two years of the pandemic, about 90,000 more people died in the United States due to cardiovascular disease than would have been expected in that same time frame. True, most of these deaths were in group of people most vulnerable to Covid: people aged 65 and older. But there was also a distinct, steep rise in heart-related deaths among people aged 25 to 44.\\n\\nThe explanation as to why Covid affects the heart is more a theory at this point, but cardiologists believe it has to do with widespread inflammation in the body produced by the virus, as the New York Times reported in September. Infection kickstarts the immune system, which releases proteins that cause inflammation. Complications might follow for people with pre-existing plaque buildup due to coronary artery disease: The inflammation can be just enough to induce a plaque rupture, leading to a clogged coronary artery, from which a heart attack will follow.\\n\\nFor this and other reasons, it’s ideal to avoid getting Covid if you can. Covid vaccinations are one way to do it, yet some men worry about their effects on the heart, too.\\n\\nThere's a Link Between Vaccines and the Heart\\n\\nFirst things first: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that evidence from various countries “supports a causal association between mRNA Covid-19 vaccines…and myocarditis and pericarditis.” The former is inflammation of the heart muscle, while the latter is inflammation of the lining outside the heart. The American Heart Association (AHA) also notes that vaccine-related myocarditis can occur, with the risk highest among teenage boys and young men. Males between 12 and 29 have the greatest risk of heart complications following a Covid-19 vaccine.\\n\\nIn September, the CDC released some of the most up-to-date information it has about the link between Covid shots and heart inflammation. One way to look at this is by incidence rate, or the probability of a certain medical condition occurring within a specific population of people. For males aged 12 to 15, the rate of developing myocarditis or pericarditis within a week after receiving a Covid-19 booster shot was about 61 in one million. The incidence rate for guys who are 16 or 17 was 188 in one million. For men between the ages of 18 and 29, the incidence rate was about 42 in one million.\\n\\nBut Covid Affects Your Heart More Than the Vaccines\\n\\nThe CDC also noted in that same report that the “risk [of] adverse cardiac outcomes were 1.8 to 5.6 times higher” after Covid-19 infection for males between the ages of 12 and 17 years compared to the risk associated with receiving a Covid-19 shot. Another CDC study from 2022 shows that males most at risk for complications following the Covid-19 vaccine are as much as eight times more likely to develop myocarditis from contracting Covid-19 than from getting a Covid-19 shot.\\n\\nLet’s review that: “Myocarditis can be much more commonly from Covid itself than from Covid vaccines,” says Lili Barouch, M.D., who heads up Johns Hopkins Medicine’s sports cardiology program.\\n\\nMany young men who get myocarditis after vaccinations recover fine, although time to recovery can vary. One survey conducted by the CDC included responses from 309 cardiologists treating vaccinated males between the ages of 12 of 29. Those healthcare providers reported full recovery times ranging from two weeks to five months. And preliminary safety data from Pfizer-BioNTech regarding its bivalent boosters—shots that protect against multiple Covid variants—indicated zero cases of myocarditis in a population of 55,649 males. Furthermore, cases of vaccine-related myocarditis or pericarditis tend to be mild in comparison to an active infection, according to research conducted in Israel and published in the AMA journal Circulation in 2022.\",\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'New York, Oct 25 (AP) Tens of thousands of books are being banned or restricted by US prisons, according to a new report from PEN America. The list includes everything from self-help books to an Elmore Leonard novel.\\n\\n“The common concept underpinning the censorship we\\'re seeing is that certain ideas and information are a threat,” says the report\\'s co-author, Moira Marquis, senior manager in the prison and justice writing department at PEN, the literary and free expression organisation.\\n\\nAlso Read | Australia Shocker: Woman Falls Through Floor of Her Rental Home in Melbourne, Finds She Was Pregnant and Suffered Miscarriage; Sues Landlord.\\n\\nTimed to the start Wednesday of Prison Banned Books Week, “Reading Between the Bars” draws upon public record requests, calls from PEN to prison mailrooms, dozens of accounts from inmates and PEN\\'s struggles to distribute its guide for prison writing, “The Sentences That Create Us: Crafting A Writer\\'s Life in Prison,\" which came out last year.\\n\\nMarquis said that the most common official reasons for bans are security and sexual content, terms that can apply to a very wide range of titles. Michigan\\'s “restricted” list includes Leonard\\'s thriller “Cuba Libre,” set right before the 1898 Spanish-American War, and Frederick Forsyth\\'s “The Day of the Jackal,” about a professional assassin\\'s attempt to murder French President Charles de Gaulle in the 1960s. Both novels were cited as a “threat to the order/security of institution.”\\n\\nAlso Read | Israel-Hamas Conflict: We Will Not Accept Displacement of Palestinians From Their Homes in Gaza, Says Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.\\n\\n“One of the books (\\'Day of the Jackal\\') deals with the planned assassination of a political leader/methods for engaging in such activities and the second (\\'Cuba Libre\\') deals with an individual engaged in various criminal enterprises,” a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections told The Associated in an email. “As part of the updated restricted publication process, a new Literary Review Committee has been formed to review items that were previously placed on the restricted publication list, to determine if they should remain or be removed.”\\n\\nAmy Schumer\\'s memoir “The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo” was flagged by Florida officials for graphic sexual content and for being “a threat to the security, order, or rehabilitative objectives of the correctional system or the safety of any person.”\\n\\nOther books to appear on banned lists: Sun Tzu\\'s “The Art of War,” the compilation “Prison Ramen: Recipes and Stories from Behind Bars,” Barrington Barber\\'s “Anyone Can Draw: Create Sensational Artwork in Easy Steps\" and Robert Greene\\'s self-help best-seller “48 Laws of Power.”\\n\\n“It\\'s a form of control. It\\'s the ultimate form of power of manipulation,\" Greene said in a statement issued through PEN.\\n\\nIn its report, PEN found parallels between the frequency of prison bans and book bannings in schools and libraries. In Florida, PEN has estimated that more than 40 per cent of all library bans took place in Florida in 2022. Meanwhile, the organisation found that more than 22,000 books are banned from Florida prisons — the highest of any state — as of early this year, with some entries dating back to the 1990s. Texas, another frequent site of library bannings, had more than 10,000 prison book bans, second only to Florida.\\n\\nIncidents of banning are likely much higher than what PEN has compiled, according to “Reading Between the Bars,” because record keeping by many prisons is erratic or non-existent. Kentucky and New Mexico are among more than 20 states that do not keep centralized records.\\n\\n\"Prison book programs have mostly tried to raise awareness locally when prisons implement new censorship restrictions for communities they serve,\" the report reads. “But these programs are largely run by volunteers and struggle to keep up with the demand for books even absent censorship. The upshot is that there have been few nationwide efforts to analyze trends in carceral censorship.”\\n\\nMarquis says that PEN places bans into two categories: content-specific, in which books are banned because of what they say or allegedly say, and content-neutral, in which books are restricted because they are not sent through accepted channels.\\n\\nIn Maine, Michigan and other states, prisoners may only receive books through a select number of vendors, whether Amazon.com, a local bookstore or an approved publisher. In Idaho, Amazon and Barnes & Noble are not among the nine approved sellers, which include Books a Million and the Women\\'s Prison Book Project.\\n\\nContent-neutral restrictions may also apply to the packaging (some federal facilities only permit white wrapping, Marquis says), and against free or used literature “because the intended recipient did not receive permission from a warden — or similar administrator — for each specific title mailed to them before the literature arrived,” according to Marquis.\\n\\nA spokesman for the Idaho Department of Correction told the AP in an email that restrictions on packaging had become necessary because of “an increase in the amount of drug-soaked mail being sent to our residents.” He added that inmates can receive books and periodicals free of charge from authorised vendors and publishers.\\n\\n“We believe our guidelines area a reasonable response to a growing problem that puts the health and safety of the people who live and work in Idaho\\'s correctional facilities at risk,” he said.\\n\\n“Reading Between the Bars” follows a study released late in 2022 by the non-profit Marshall Project, which found some 50,000 banned prison titles, based on lists made available by 25 states. In 2019, a PEN report explored different levels of prison bans — from individuals not permitted to receive a given book to state-wide restrictions — and determined that restrictions were both widespread and arbitrary.\\n\\n“With over two million Americans incarcerated, the book-restriction regulations within the United States carceral system represent the largest book ban policy in the United States,” the 2019 study reads in part. “The reality of book banning in American prisons is systematic and comprehensive. State and federal prison authorities censor content with little oversight or public scrutiny. Often the ultimate decision-maker about a person\\'s right to read is housed in the prison mailroom.”(AP)\\n\\n(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)',\n",

       " {'articleBody': \"CLAIM New England Journal of Medicine “proves” 80% miscarriage rate among vaccinated women; COVID-19 vaccines harm men’s and women’s fertility more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Christiane Northrup, James Thorp, Children's Health Defense, NVTV, 20 Sep. 2023 DETAILS Flawed reasoning: The 80% miscarriage figure is based on flawed calculations using partial data from a preliminary study. This study actually concluded that the data showed no obvious safety concerns for pregnant women.\\n\\nIncorrect: There is no biological mechanism by which COVID-19 vaccines might cause shedding of the virus or the spike protein. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccines can’t explain adverse events in unvaccinated people.\\n\\nMisleading: While COVID-19 vaccines have been associated with small changes in menstrual cycles, these are within the range of normal variation. No studies suggest that vaccination harms fertility. KEY TAKE AWAY Misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines harming fertility is a widespread myth that has damaged public trust in the vaccines. While the original vaccine clinical trials didn’t evaluate the effects of COVID-19 vaccines on fertility, scientific studies and safety surveillance data later on have shown that COVID-19 vaccines are safe for pregnant women and don’t cause pregnancy or fertility problems. COVID-19 itself is associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications, which vaccination can help prevent.\\n\\nFULL CLAIM: New England Journal of Medicine “proves” 80% miscarriage rate among vaccinated women; Many women “will never be able to get pregnant because they had that shot”; “The sperm of inoculated men does not swim. The eggs of inoculated women do not grow into embryos”\\n\\nREVIEW\\n\\nClaims blaming COVID-19 vaccines for innumerable alleged harmful effects have been a constant throughout the pandemic. One persistent claim that spread even before a COVID-19 vaccine was available is that the vaccines cause infertility. This narrative has contributed to vaccine hesitancy, a stance with potentially harmful consequences.\\n\\nOn 20 September 2023, a Facebook video featuring gynecologist Christiane Northrup revived this old claim. The video received over 1,300 interactions and 1,400 shares.\\n\\nNorthrup’s video is a segment of a “Friday Roundtable” originally uploaded by the anti-vaccine organization Children’s Health Defense (CHD) in June 2022. This event revolved around a pseudo-documentary that had just been released titled “Infertility: A Diabolical Agenda”, produced by CHD founder Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and directed by former physician Andrew Wakefield, also present in the roundtable.\\n\\nAn article by the McGill Office for Science and Society referred to Wakefield’s film as an “Anti-Vaxx Sleight-of-Hand Propaganda”. Indeed, the central argument in the film is an old depopulation conspiracy theory claiming that vaccination campaigns aimed at eliminating maternal and neonatal tetanus in Kenya are just a cover-up for forcibly sterilizing women.\\n\\nThis claim, which dates back to the 1990s, is false and has been debunked thoroughly.\\n\\nThe film isn’t the first instance of Wakefield spreading misinformation about vaccines. He led a now-retracted study that incorrectly linked the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism. The study was found to contain several critical flaws, including data fabrication and ethical violations. However, the belief that vaccines cause autism has persisted, even though many well-conducted studies published later showed no such association.\\n\\nApart from Northrup and Wakefield, the roundtable gathered several other personalities in the anti-vaccine community, including chemical engineer Brian Hooker, pediatrician Liz Mumper, and gynecologist James Thorp.\\n\\nNorthrup’s speech supposedly provided evidence that COVID-19 vaccines harm fertility, particularly in women. However, the data that Northrup cited doesn’t support her claim, as they don’t come from reliable scientific studies but from partial analyses with many critical flaws, as we will explain below.\\n\\nClaim 1 (Flawed reasoning):\\n\\nRaw data from a study published in the New England Journal “proves that 80% of the women who get the shot in the first and second trimester, basically zero to 20 weeks, have an 80% miscarriage rate. Now the miscarriage rate just baseline is one in six”\\n\\nThis claim, which made the rounds online in July 2021, is based on a study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in June 2021[1]. In it, the authors evaluated the safety of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant women using reports from the U.S. vaccine safety surveillance systems.\\n\\nNorthrup wasn’t the only one who has made this claim. In August 2023, another participant in the Friday Roundtable, Thorp, cited the same figure in a video interview with broadcast host Nicholas Veniamin.\\n\\nBut the 80% figure that Northrup and Thorp cited is based on flawed calculations that misrepresent the results of the study, as Health Feedback showed in an earlier review. Reuters, Full Fact, FactCheck.org, and PolitiFact, among others, also debunked the claim, pointing out the same flaws.\\n\\nBriefly, the CDC analyzed data from 827 pregnant women who had received a COVID-19 vaccine and completed pregnancy—either with a positive or a negative outcome—before the study was released. Then, the authors calculated the rate of negative pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriage.\\n\\nAmong them, 104 (12.6%) experienced a miscarriage, a rate similar to that reported in other studies in pregnant women conducted before the pandemic. Therefore, the authors concluded that these results, although preliminary, didn’t suggest that the vaccine posed a risk to pregnant women.\\n\\nHowever, some websites and social media posts argued that the authors should have calculated the miscarriage rate differently. Because miscarriage by definition can only occur in the first or second trimester, they asserted that all women who received the vaccine in the third trimester (700) should have been excluded from the calculation of the miscarriage rate, which would result in a miscarriage rate of 81.9% (104 out of 127).\\n\\nBut this calculation is incorrect and overrepresents miscarriages. When interpreting the study, it’s important to keep in mind that the study had been published somewhere between four to six months after the women included had been vaccinated. What this means is that most women who had been vaccinated in the first or second trimester could only have completed their pregnancy by the time of the study’s publication if they had miscarried or had an abortion.\\n\\nTherefore, calculating the miscarriage rate in only women vaccinated during their first or second trimester with a completed pregnancy selects for a group in which miscarriage is the most likely outcome. And the minority who didn’t had an induced abortion instead, as the study’s data showed.\\n\\nWhat would have been needed to calculate an accurate miscarriage rate was the pregnancy outcomes for all of the women vaccinated during their first and second trimester. However, the authors couldn’t obtain this information before the study was published, since many of these women’s pregnancies were still in progress.\\n\\nMultiple robust studies conducted later show that COVID-19 vaccines aren’t associated with a higher risk of poor pregnancy outcomes, and don’t support the claim that COVID-19 vaccination jeopardizes pregnant women or their babies[2-8]. On the contrary, by preventing severe illness, vaccination can actually reduce the risk of negative outcomes for both the mother and the baby[9].\\n\\nClaim 2 (Unsupported and Misleading):\\n\\n“We had a group of about 20,000 women on Facebook who were talking about their experience with their menstrual cycle; they’d never seen anything like it. 90-year-olds beginning bleeding again. And we are not talking mild bleeding, we are talking clotting”\\n\\nOne of the central pieces of evidence in Northrup’s narrative that COVID-19 vaccines harm fertility is a project called My Cycle Story, which she conducted together with Thorp and Hooker, among others. According to the website, the project’s objective was to evaluate the effect of “exposure” to the spike protein on women’s reproductive health.\\n\\nTo do that, Northrup and colleagues distributed through social media a survey with 91 questions. A total of more than 6,000 women aged 18 years and above responded to the survey between 16 May 2021 and 31 December 2021. Then, based on the data collected, they conducted several analyses.\\n\\nOne of these analyses focused on the 3,390 unvaccinated women who hadn’t had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and therefore, had “no prior exposure to the spike protein”. The website claimed that 85.5% of these women “had been in close proximity to someone who had been vaccinated” and that 71.7% of them reported irregular periods “Within a week of contact”.\\n\\nNorthrup and colleagues concluded that “proximity to vaccinated individuals increased the risk” of menstrual abnormalities, “suggesting a potential link” between these changes and COVID-19 vaccines. However, this conclusion is entirely based on the idea that people who received a COVID-19 vaccine can “pass” it to others, which is incorrect. As Health Feedback explained in an earlier review, there is no biological mechanism by which COVID-19 vaccines could cause shedding of either the virus or the spike protein.\\n\\nViral shedding is a phenomenon that can occur in live attenuated vaccines—like the vaccines against chickenpox—which use a live but weakened virus to induce immunity. People who receive this type of vaccine can produce and excrete vaccine-derived virus that may still retain the ability to replicate in cells. While these viruses are generally innocuous in healthy people, they might cause disease in some people like those with a weakened immune system.\\n\\nHowever, none of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. and Europe use live virus. Most COVID-19 vaccines to date don’t even use the whole virus but only part of it, generally the spike protein. With regards to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines specifically, they don’t contain the spike protein itself but rather the instructions that allow the cells to produce it. The mRNA and the spike protein have only a limited lifespan in the body and the small quantities in which they are produced haven’t been shown to cause harm.\\n\\nIn summary, the claim that unvaccinated women are experiencing changes in their menstrual cycles due to shedding from vaccinated people is baseless. Furthermore, the available evidence doesn’t suggest any safety concerns regarding menstrual cycles.\\n\\nWhile the original clinical trials didn’t evaluate the effect of vaccination on menstrual cycles, several large studies since have addressed this question.\\n\\nIn January 2022, Edelman et al. published in Obstetrics & Gynecology the first study analyzing the effects of COVID-19 vaccines on menstruation in nearly 4,000 U.S. women aged 18 to 45[10]. The study found that receiving one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine was associated with an increase in cycle length of less than one day compared to unvaccinated women.\\n\\nThe authors confirmed these results in a follow-up international study involving more than 19,000 women and published in the British Medical Journal in August 2022[11].\\n\\nIt is important to note, however, that changes in cycle length of less than eight days are considered within the range of normal variability. Therefore, while the researchers did find a change, the small difference observed is very unlikely to have any clinical relevance.\\n\\nThe largest study published so far was conducted by researchers in Sweden and published in the British Medical Journal in May 2023[12]. This study analyzed data from more than three million women and concluded that their findings “do not provide any substantial support for a causal association between covid-19 vaccination and healthcare contacts related to menstrual or bleeding disorders”, which directly contradicts Northrup’s claim.\\n\\nClaim 3 (Unsupported and Misleading):\\n\\n“269 women reported [decidual cast shedding]”; “It’s doing something to the coagulation pathways in the body. That is just the tip of the iceberg. I keep thinking when these young women realize they will never be able to get pregnant because they had that shot”\\n\\nAgain relying on the My Cycle Story survey, Northrup published a report focusing on decidual cast shedding (DCS), a rare gynecological event in which the lining of the uterus (endometrium) sheds in one large piece during menstruation. The report was published in the Gazette of Medical Sciences in April 2022. We couldn’t find this journal indexed in the scientific literature databases MEDLINE, PubMed Central (PMC), Web of Science, and Scopus.\\n\\nAmong all surveyed women, 292 (4.83%) reported having experienced DCS for the first time within the survey period, which the authors considered “unprecedented” compared to the baseline rate in the general population. The report also suggested that “exposure to the spike protein, either through natural exposure, vaccination, or shedding of the spike protein through exosomes” might be behind this and other menstrual abnormalities.\\n\\nNorthrup and colleagues then speculated that the alleged surge in DCS cases is due to coagulation problems caused by the COVID-19 vaccines.\\n\\nBut what Northrup didn’t say is that DCS isn’t usually a sign of a serious health problem. Although this event could be a sign of ectopic pregnancy in certain cases, especially when combined with other symptoms like sudden intense pain, this event alone generally isn’t associated with long-term medical problems or infertility, contrary to Northrup’s claim.\\n\\nFurthermore, as we explained above, COVID-19 vaccines don’t cause shedding, and therefore can’t explain adverse events that occurred in unvaccinated people.\\n\\nIn addition, the report itself stated that literature about DCS is scarce, most of it consisting of case reports that “cannot determine a reliable prevalence of DCS events”.\\n\\nKaren Duncan, an obstetrician and gynecologist at NYU Langone Health, told Bustle that decidual casts “are not commonly mentioned in OB-GYN textbooks and are mostly described in rare case studies in scientific literature”. The Cleveland Clinic also states that decidual casts are “rare” and “the exact number is unknown”.\\n\\nOverall, this raises questions about how Northrup determined that the rate has increased, if there isn’t a reliable baseline estimate to compare current rates with.\\n\\nFinally, the report itself stated that the survey “was not designed to determine the etiopathophysiology of this surge in DCS”. So, even if there were an increase, the report would be unable to establish its cause. Surveys can be very prone to biases, such as bias in the way participants are selected (selection bias) or a tendency for participants to retrieve information that confirms their own pre-existing ideas or beliefs (confirmation bias). These biases need to be minimized and corrected for[13]. However, there is no indication that the authors tried to make such corrections in the report.\\n\\nClaim 4 (Unsupported):\\n\\nFertility clinics have “never seen anything like it. The sperm of inoculated men does not swim. The eggs of inoculated women do not grow into embryos and those that do have a huge amount of contamination with stuff that’s non organic”\\n\\nNorthrup made this claim without providing any supporting data, only citing Carrie Madej as the source. Madej is an osteopath who spread the false claim that COVID-19 vaccines contain nano-technology living parasites. Health Feedback reviewed this claim in 2021, explaining that COVID-19 vaccines don’t contain living organisms of any kind, and there is no evidence that the organisms that Madej described even exist.\\n\\nLikewise, the claim that COVID-19 vaccines impact men’s or women’s ability to conceive isn’t supported by any credible evidence. Studies on couples trying to conceive with[14] and without fertility treatment[15] showed no differences in the likelihood of conception between vaccinated and unvaccinated couples.\\n\\nSeveral studies evaluated the potential impact of COVID-19 vaccines on sperm. One small study involving 37 men in Israel reported a temporary drop in sperm count after a second dose of the BioNTech-Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine[16]. The authors attributed this effect to the fever that often occurs as a side effect of vaccination, and noted that the sperm wasn’t damaged and the counts returned to normal levels after a few months.\\n\\nBut other studies found no differences in the sperm’s volume, concentration, morphology and motility between vaccinated and unvaccinated men[17-20]. In contrast, several studies have reported a decrease in sperm counts and quality following a SARS-CoV-2 infection[21-23].\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nClaims that COVID-19 vaccines cause fertility and pregnancy problems are unsubstantiated and contradict the available evidence. Published studies so far show that COVID-19 vaccines are safe for pregnant women and not associated with pregnancy complications or infertility in men or women. It is COVID-19 itself that increases the risk of pregnancy complications and poses a risk to both the mother and the baby. Contrary to these claims, COVID-19 vaccination helps reduce the risk of harm to the mother and baby.\\n\\nREFERENCES\",\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'This conversation is part of a series of interviews in which JAMA Editor in Chief Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, PhD, MD, MAS, and expert guests explore issues surrounding the rapidly evolving intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and medicine.\\n\\nHow is generative AI catalyzing a paradigm shift in medical education? What will it mean for AI to assist in medical school applications or clinical teaching? And can AI be harnessed to elevate the skills and acumen of clinicians while also allowing them to connect more deeply with their humanity in encounters with patients?\\n\\nNeedless to say, when it comes to med school, it’s a brave new world.\\n\\nIt’s the world Bernard S. Chang, MD, MMSc (Video), has been steeped in since being named dean for medical education at Harvard Medical School this summer. JAMA Editor in Chief Kirsten Bibbins Domingo, PhD, MD, MAS, recently spoke with Chang, who is the Daniel D. Federman, MD, professor of neurology at Harvard and a practicing neurologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\\n\\nVideo. AI and Clinical Practice—Can AI Accelerate Medical Education?\\n\\nThe following is an edited version of their conversation.\\n\\nDr Bibbins-Domingo:Well, it is an interesting time for medical schools. You recently wrote an editorial that accompanied what JAMA publishes every year about the demographics of the students in medical schools in the US. Your editorial focused on how AI is going to transform medical education.\\n\\nDr Chang:I think this is about to be a major inflection point in medical education akin to what we experienced when the internet and internet search engines became available. The internet was around when I was in medical school in the mid-1990s, but it wasn’t really a source of medical information. Certainly as students, we didn’t go to the internet to help in our courses or help to learn material. But when search engines became available, it became clear that access to knowledge was so much easier and cheaper and simpler than it had been before. And what many medical schools around that time did was evolve their curriculum from one that emphasized lectures, which of course are very efficient ways of transferring facts and knowledge, to small group discussion formats which are more beneficial toward knowledge integration and knowledge analysis and interpretation and help students with oral presentation skills.\\n\\nDr Bibbins-Domingo:So it’s not as much that we have to memorize everything and just have all of that knowledge transferred to us. It’s more that medical education is focused on the higher-order skills of integrating that knowledge to try to make a clinical decision.\\n\\nDr Chang:Exactly. And I think coming up in these next few years, we’re going to have a similar transformation, which is that what generative artificial intelligence, these AI tools like ChatGPT, can do very effectively is summarize and even analyze and even make probabilistic decisions for us using data that we provide to it.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so like what happened years ago, I think in undergraduate medical education we need to similarly evolve our curricula to reflect this new era. Our students of course still need to learn the fundamentals of how to be a doctor. That will never change. But we can more quickly move our students toward doing even higher levels of cognitive analysis, higher levels of understanding the individual patient nuance, which I think might still be difficult for AI to handle. Higher levels of compassionate and culturally competent communication, which we know AI might have some difficulty with. And returning students to the primacy of the physical exam, which as far as I know chatbots are not going to be replacing in the next few years.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo in other words, what I point out in my Viewpoint is that we need our students to be even more human in their doctoring skills than ever before, working at the highest levels of cognitive analysis, [engaging in] the most personally nuanced forms of communication, and remembering the importance of the actual laying on of hands.\\n\\nDr Bibbins-Domingo:Let’s take those 3 elements together. We already know that things like ChatGPT take tests pretty well, but you are challenging us that the medical student then of the future will need to not just be building this font of knowledge but be even better at integrating and figuring out how to synthesize that knowledge for the types of clinical decisions that are being made. So they might rely on ChatGPT for a first order, but they have to be even better using their human skills at figuring out how to integrate that for the patient. ChatGPT communicates, it seems to be very good at being empathetic, but you’re challenging us to be more human in our communication skills that we are teaching medical students. And then the physical exam, which presumably these gen [generative] AI tools are not going to ever be able to do.\\n\\nDr Chang:Right. So as an example, we know that ChatGPT when given a set of signs and symptoms can produce a fairly good differential diagnosis. And that’s something that we still need to teach our students, but maybe more quickly than before we can move our students to a level at which they’re working with that differential diagnosis to make it individualized to their particular patient. To take into account some of the particular nuances and specifics of their patient’s history or their patient’s lived experience that ChatGPT really can’t take into account. And that’s where their role as medical students and future doctors can be most useful.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe want to train our students to be the physicians of the future who are going to be AI-enabled physicians. Artificial intelligence is not going to replace physicians, right? But physicians who use artificial intelligence are really going to be working at the top of their game in clinical medicine. So we want to train our medical students to be those physicians, to be the physicians who in a clinical visit can really focus on that interpersonal interaction to really get to know their patients as human beings, to be that compassionate provider, and to do the most incisive levels of clinical decision-making while AI is presumably running in the background and doing some of the lower-level tasks that otherwise would’ve occupied those physicians in the past.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo it’s not that we don’t need to start from the basics. Of course medical students need to start from the basics, but I believe they can move more quickly from the basics to more advanced levels of reasoning and communication, knowing that they’ll be supported by AI in the future to do the fundamentals of decision analysis and communication.\\n\\nDr Bibbins-Domingo:What I like about your piece so much is that it seems like this natural evolution. We used to never think we would have calculators at exams or we would never have these other types of catalogs of medical knowledge as a part of our exams. And now we routinely accept them because we want our clinicians to be functioning at much higher levels. So it resonates so much for me what you’ve written. Now, how do we do that? How are you going to do that at Harvard Medical School?\\n\\nDr Chang:Our students learn to take a history, they learn to perform a physical exam, and then they learn to write a proper clinical note. And then we ask them to do it over and over and over again to basically instill that into their minds and show us with confidence that they can automatically generate solid clinical notes that are interpretable by other providers. Well, we know that ChatGPT writes pretty good clinical notes if given the right inputs. So I’d love for our students to learn the basics of history and physical exam and writing clinical notes. But instead of spending as much time as we do now writing notes over and over and over again, we can move our students to higher levels of analysis and interpretation earlier in their medical education.\\n\\nDr Bibbins-Domingo:So you’re not talking about replacing the building blocks. You’re talking about moving more quickly through those to get to the point that we’re actually focused on still, the big gap between what we learn in medical education and what we need as a practicing physician. How do we do that? Where do you see the changes? Are they going to be in the first few years of medical education? Are they going to be in the later years? I recognize you’re a new dean, but do you have a sense of what type of things will look different as we go into the future?\\n\\nDr Chang:Honestly, I think every phase of medical education is going to look different and every phase of undergraduate medical education, from preclerkship curriculum to the clinical clerkships to the postclerkship phase. I think everything is going to look different. In the preclerkship curriculum, for example, in the basic science and social science courses, AI is going to be present as an educational tool. It’s already happening. The entering class of first-year students, many of them were college seniors when ChatGPT became available last academic year, and they are now going to be using ChatGPT, GPT-4, and other tools like that to help them learn, to help them preview the material in our flipped classroom environment, to help them consolidate the knowledge afterward, and to study the content for exams.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo that’s already present. They’re using it as an educational tool. They can use it to serve as a self-tutor because you can ask ChatGPT to serve as a tutor, to test you with certain questions, and to alter the level of difficulty of the questions based on your responses. So already that’s right from the beginning of medical school.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn our clinical skills course where we’re preparing our students to be able to have the fundamental building blocks to go onto the clerkships, again, I think we’re going to be able to use the fact that ChatGPT is available to move our students to those higher-level clinical skills earlier on. And then I think after the clerkships, as students are exploring subinternships and electives and thinking about applying to residencies, of course this is going to be 2 or 3 years from now for our entering students, and we will have 2 or 3 years of generative AI under our belts. I think it’s going to play a very large role in our students’ experience as they, as subinterns, actually lead the care of their own inpatients on teams.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe’re already seeing that among our house officers, who after all are some of the primary teachers of our students, among our residents and fellows ChatGPT is being used to help refine a differential diagnosis to make sure that nothing is missed, to help with some of the difficult or rare conditions that we know that AI can be very helpful for and that sometimes humans have cognitive biases against. And so as our students see this being used by residents and fellows and attendings on the wards, that’s going to be part of their education because AI is going to be part of the future of clinical medicine. And just like any aspect of clinical medicine, as medical school leaders, we need to adapt what we’re teaching and how we’re teaching to prepare our students for clinical medicine in the future.\\n\\nDr Bibbins-Domingo:When these types of generative AI tools first came into prominence or awareness, educators, whatever level of education they were involved with, had to scramble because their students were using them. They were figuring out how to put up the right types of guardrails, set the right types of rules. Are there rules or danger zones right now that you’re thinking about?\\n\\nDr Chang:Absolutely, and I think there’s quite a number of these. This is a focus that we’re embarking on right now because as exciting as the future is and as much potential as these generative AI tools have, there are also dangers and there are also concerns that we have to address.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of them is helping our students, who like all of us are still new to this within the past year, understand the limitations of these tools. Now these tools are going to get better year after year after year, but right now they are still prone to hallucinations, or basically making up facts that aren’t really true and yet saying them with confidence. Our students need to recognize why it is that these tools might come up with those hallucinations to try to learn how to recognize them and to basically be on guard for the fact that just because ChatGPT is giving you a very confident answer, it doesn’t mean it’s the right answer. And in medicine of course, that’s very, very important. And so that’s one—just the accuracy and the validity of the content that comes out.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I wrote about in my Viewpoint, the way that these tools work is basically a very fancy form of autocomplete, right? It is essentially using a probabilistic prediction of what the next word is going to be. And so there’s no separate validity or confirmation of the factual material, and that’s something that we need to make sure that our students understand.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe other thing is to address the fact that these tools may inherently be structurally biased. Now, why would that be? Well, as we know, ChatGPT and these other large language models [LLMs] are trained on the world’s internet, so to speak, right? They’re trained on the noncopyrighted corpus of material that’s out there on the web. And to the extent that that corpus of material was generated by human beings who in their postings and their writings exhibit bias in one way or the other, whether intentionally or not, that’s the corpus on which these LLMs are trained. So it only makes sense that when we use these tools, these tools are going to potentially exhibit evidence of bias. And so we need our students to be very aware of that. As we have worked to reduce the effects of systematic bias in our curriculum and in our clinical sphere, we need to recognize that as we introduce this new tool, this will be another potential source of bias.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou alluded to the fact that we need to help our students understand what the right use of these tools is. Is it okay to use these tools to write an assignment? Is it okay to use these tools to help yourself study? Is it okay to use these tools to draft that clinical note, that writeup on the patient that you just saw in your doctoring course? Well, we need to establish a set of educational policies and so forth to make sure that our students are still learning the basics and are using these tools as aids to their education and aids to their work.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou used the calculator analogy before. A student who started with a calculator right at the beginning might not ever learn basic arithmetic, but once you’ve learned basic arithmetic, we want you to be able to go on to learn more advanced forms of mathematics by using a calculator to help you take care of the basic arithmetic more quickly and without as many errors. And that’s what we need to tell our students about for ChatGPT.\\n\\nDr Bibbins-Domingo:I like that. It does strike me that even language models that are not trained on all the world’s information on the internet but are just trained on health care data, the challenge is that it risks learning the patterns of bias and not optimal care that we in medicine have delivered for our patients.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the things that I’ve loved being part of an educational institution, and I’m sure I suspect the same is for you, is teaching the next generation of clinicians to imagine the world different than what we have currently created. It’s good, but we also want it to be better. And that’s part of the ambition, I think, for medical schools. And so it feels like that’s another thing—placing these tools in context as one of the tools but not something that substitutes from imagining the world differently than what currently exists.\\n\\nDr Chang:Absolutely. It seems a little bit counterintuitive to be talking about how we may be able to strengthen and return to more of that humanistic patient-physician encounter in the face of a computational revolution here. But I really believe it. I’d love to see in the future our medical students and future physicians be able to spend more time at the bedside, more time looking at the patient, and less time typing over on the keyboard. More time concentrating on the individual nuanced communication and making sure that everything is being understood and less time worrying about whether this or the other fact is going to be recalled.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I’m imagining that after a clinical encounter, which is going to be more face-to-face time and more effective in compassionate communication, then the physician will be able to turn to the screen aided by AI and have a note drafted, have a differential diagnosis listed, have laboratory results from the online medical record that might be relevant to the conversation pulled up, maybe have letters to consultants already drafted—things that might’ve otherwise taken the physician quite a lot of time to search for in the past. And knowing that that is running in the background should give me as the physician more opportunity and more leeway to spend time talking with my patient the way I really ought to have been all along.\\n\\nDr Bibbins-Domingo:So as applicants to medical school become more AI savvy, what will be the impact either on the process of going to medical school or the class that you’ve admitted?\\n\\nDr Chang:This is a question that is at the top of our minds because one of the things that I think AI can help us with is distinguishing the content with which we are judging our applicants from the fluency and readability of their language.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I think it’s very difficult for us to separate those two things. When a personal statement reads very well and sounds very good, we are naturally inclined to think, wow, this is somebody who expresses themselves very well and we’re naturally inclined to think that the content of what they’ve said, the substance of what they’ve said, is very valuable. And while that may be true in certain circumstances, I think it does inherently carry some bias against those for whom English was not a native language or their first language and against those for whom other forms of expression are more natural to them.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think AI will level the playing field there, and it will force us to look more closely at the substance of what people are writing, the nature of their experiences, why they actually want to become physicians, what their visions for a career in medicine are, and not just simply the surface readability or fluency of their language, because ChatGPT can make everybody sound fluent in that way.\\n\\nDr Bibbins-Domingo:I certainly agree with you. As in our business in the editorial and publishing world, being able to have publishing be more accessible to a range of authors because they can give us a manuscript that sounds or reads much more like what we’re used to reading—that certainly resonates for me. But aren’t you worried we’re going to get the empathy from ChatGPT and confuse it with whether that person who’s applying is really that wonderful, empathetic human being who might make a good doctor?\\n\\nDr Chang:It’s a great question, and I think that’s something that we’re going to struggle with. ChatGPT generates what I would call generically empathic statements. It’s very good at doing that, but we don’t want generically empathic doctors. We want medical students who are going to take their own experiences and learn from their patients who have their own lived experiences and generate authentic conversations and authentic communication to help with that patient’s health. And I think that’s going to be the job of our admissions committees, which is to look beyond the generically empathic statements to see the substance behind what our students, our applicants, are offering and the substance behind their internal drive to come to the field of medicine.\\n\\nDr Bibbins-Domingo:I have one more question for you. We have all of these wonderful applicants and entering students who have lived in this AI world and then they’re still being taught by the faculty. How are you going to train us faculty members to be the faculty of the future?\\n\\nDr Chang:This is a great point, and this is a major challenge for us, but it’s also a great opportunity. Our faculty are excited to learn. They need to learn. They are not naive to this. They need to learn, but they want to learn because they see the potential for what this can mean for the education of our students.\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst of all, they see, frankly, the potential that this can make their work a little bit quicker and a little bit easier in terms of generating new content, generating assessment questions, finding ways to instruct the students, and also to test the students on their knowledge. So in some ways, this is a tool that will make our faculty’s job easier, but what we need to do in medical school is work on faculty development. And we’re going to spend a lot of this next year doing that.\\n\\n\\n\\nRight now anyway, there’s no better way to learn how these tools work than to try them. And that’s been our mantra to our faculty, which is just try it, try it, try it. Using your current course materials, try it with what you’re doing on the clerkships right now, or what you’re doing in the subinternships right now, and don’t just rely on the first response. And so we’ve had a couple of different messages for our faculty.\\n\\n\\n\\nNumber one is that “generative” is the key word in generative AI. This is not just a fancy Google search. Don’t use it just to try to find some more obscure fact than you were going to find on Google. This generates content for you. It writes human-sounding text for you. So it plays its most important role at times when you need to generate, when you need to write, when you need to create text content for the page. And that’s one thing we’re telling our faculty.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother thing we’re telling our faculty is the importance of what’s now known as prompt engineering, which is knowing what questions to ask. It’s funny because that’s an old-fashioned thing we tell our students on the wards, right? That when students say, “That patient was a poor historian,” perhaps, in fact, it’s because you didn’t ask the right questions. And it’s the same thing with these generative AI tools. The quality of the prompt that you give it is proportional to the quality of the response that you’re going to get. And so we have to become better at generating specific prompts that we know are going to elicit the kinds of responses that we need that are going to be most helpful.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I always tell our faculty, don’t just stop with the first response. The first answer that you get back is just a first draft, and you would never accept a first draft as your final version. So if there’s something that you don’t like about what came back, if there was an error, or if it was not quite what you were looking for, the beauty of ChatGPT is that you can converse. You can say, “Actually, that’s not quite what I was looking for. I was expecting X and Y and please don’t do Z again.” And then it’ll come back with another response. And in my experience, after just 2 or 3 iterations, you have something that’s much closer to what you intended than maybe the first try. So these are some of the simple mantras that we’ve been spreading to our faculty as they’re learning, and we’re all learning how to use these tools in our educational program.\\n\\nBack to top Article Information\\n\\nPublished Online: October 25, 2023. doi:10.1001/jama.2023.19295\\n\\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.',\n",

Meningococcal diseases are rare bacterial infections that commonly affect the brain, spinal cord and bloodstream, and can be deadly in a matter of hours.\\n\\nSanofi seeing \\'unprecedented\\' demand for RSV therapy\\n\\nFrench drugmaker Sanofi said on Friday it was seeing an \"unprecedented level\" of demand for an antibody therapy it co-developed to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a leading cause of hospitalizations in infants. The therapy, branded Beyfortus and jointly developed by Sanofi and AstraZeneca, was approved in July to prevent RSV in infants and toddlers.\\n\\nMedical device makers see limited hit from weight-loss drugs\\n\\nU.S. medical device makers do not see a big impact of new weight-loss treatments on the sales of equipment used in procedures such as bariatric surgery due to the prohibitive costs of the drugs as well as reimbursement hurdles. Intuitive Surgical, Johnson & Johnson and Abbott have all rushed in to allay fears of a hit to a lucrative slice of their business from GLP-1 drugs such as Novo Nordisk\\'s Wegovy and Ozempic, and Eli Lilly\\'s Mounjaro\\n\\nMerck signs $5.5 billion deal with Daiichi for cancer therapy development\\n\\nDrugmaker Merck will pay Daiichi Sankyo $5.5 billion to jointly develop three of its candidate cancer drugs, they said, in a deal that could be worth up to $22 billion to the Japanese firm depending on the success of the cell-targeting therapies. Shares of Daiichi Sankyo closed up 14.4% in Tokyo to post their steepest gain in more than a year, while those of Merck rose 1.6% in morning trading.\\n\\nUK online pharmacy Rightangled still selling diabetes drug Ozempic despite govt order\\n\\nUK private online pharmacy Rightangled was offering Novo Nordisk\\'s diabetes drug Ozempic for sale on Friday to people wanting to use the weekly injection to shed pounds, its website shows, even after a government order to stop doing so. Ozempic is licensed in the UK for managing blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. However, last year, many people who don\\'t have diabetes turned to Ozempic as a slimming jab, using online pharmacies prescribing it “off-label”.\\n\\nBioMarin\\'s dwarfism therapy gets FDA nod for expanded use\\n\\nThe U.S. health regulator on Friday approved the expanded use of BioMarin Pharmaceutical\\'s once-daily injection to treat children under the age of 5 with the most common form of short-limbed dwarfism. The drug, branded as Voxzogo, in 2021 was the first therapy to be greenlighted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating the genetic disorder, known as achondroplasia, in children aged five and older under the FDA\\'s accelerated approval pathway.\\n\\nUS senator asks 23andMe for details after reported data for sale online\\n\\nThe top Republican on the U.S. Senate\\'s health committee has called on the chief executive of 23andMe to provide the panel with details after data from the family genetics website was advertised for sale on the dark web. Senator Bill Cassidy, the ranking member on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, expressed concerns in a letter to CEO Anne Wojcicki, and asked for more information. A hacker advertised 23andMe data earlier this month, but 23andMe said in a statement that the company itself had not been breached.\\n\\nFirst pill for dengue shows promise in human challenge trial\\n\\nA pill for dengue fever developed by Johnson & Johnson appeared to protect against a form of the virus in a handful of patients in a small human challenge trial in the United States, according to data presented by the company on Friday. There are currently no specific treatments for dengue, a growing disease threat, the company said ahead of presentation of the data at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene Annual Meeting in Chicago.\\n\\nScientists infect volunteers with Zika in hunt for vaccines, treatments\\n\\nResearchers in the United States have shown for the first time they can safely and effectively infect human volunteers with Zika virus, a step towards learning more about the disease and developing vaccines and treatments. The study – known as a \"controlled human infection model\" – has previously been controversial for Zika because of the risks to participants and lack of treatments.\\n\\nFOCUS-Demand for weight-loss drugs fuels global rise in counterfeits\\n\\nExtraordinary demand for Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and other drugs used for weight-loss is fueling a global surge in counterfeit versions, according to Reuters interviews with law enforcement, anti-counterfeiting and public health officials. The U.S.-based Pharmaceutical Security Institute (PSI), an industry-backed organization that counts drugmakers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly as members, said it is working with agencies, including Europol, Interpol and U.S. Homeland Security, as well as companies that help identify counterfeit products such as Israel’s BrandShield.\\n\\n(With inputs from agencies.)',\n",

Younis found it ‘ special ’. The global public’s reaction was so intense and rightly so that Vicky, as Younis is fondly known, found himself compelled to extend an apology for letting the excitement of the moment sweep him away.

In that same T20 World Cup match, a Pakistani presenter Bazid Khan, casually told Pakistan team captain Babar Azam, “Kufr toot gaya”, which was interpreted as ‘idolatry being shattered’ by many fans. The nonchalant nature of such discussions in their country was evident as Azam responded with a smile, acknowledging that it was indeed over.\\n\\nBut the story doesn’t end there. Consider the instances of everyday bigotry against Hindus normalised by the who’s who of Pakistan cricket. It’s disconcerting how the team, as a whole, struggles to separate their sport from religious sentiments. It’s almost unclear whether they’re playing a game or pursuing a religious mission.\\n\\nTake a glance at a few statements made by Pakistani cricketers:\\n\\nIn 1978, Mushtaq Mohammed , then captain of the Pakistan cricket team, called Pakistan’s test series win against India a “victory of Muslims worldwide over Hindus.” Former cricketer Shahid Afridi made headlines for boasting about smashing a TV upon witnessing his daughter perform the “aarti.” Shoaib Akhtar explained the concept of Ghazwa-e-Hind and said that “we will first capture Kashmir and then invade India.” “If Muslims show their Muslim-ism, not one human on earth will remain non-Muslim,” said former captain of Pakistan’s national cricket team Inzamam-ul-Haq .\\n\\nAlso read: We are cricket-crazy and partisan, not Nazis. Stop demonising Gujarat crowd\\n\\nGame and religion\\n\\nUpon closer examination, the animosity towards Hinduism and India among Pakistani players becomes glaring. It runs so deep that former Indian all-rounder Irfan Pathan was hit by an iron nail during India’s tour of Pakistan. Remarkably, he chose not to harbour resentment or generalise the entire nation for the actions of a few. The inclination to intertwine religion with sports appears to be a longstanding habit. Rizwan recently dedicated of his match-winning performance in Hyderabad to Gaza. It further highlights the trend. In an ideal scenario, one might expect him to dedicate his win to the war-struck children of both Israel and Gaza to foster unity.\\n\\nRizwan chose a side, introducing a religious and political conflict into the realm of sports. The crowd in Ahmedabad responded to this, expressing their sentiments towards Rizwan’s consistent politicisation of religion.In an ideal world, both Rizwan and that crowd has the right to paint the world with their thought. Either Rizwan or the crowd, should be asked to not express their respective religious feelings, or both should be allowed, and we should get on with it.\\n\\nHave you ever witnessed an Indian cricketer, representing the nation at the highest international level, stoop to attacking another player’s faith or exploiting their profession to propagate conversion? Such a stance carries with it a dismissive tone, implicitly branding the other player’s faith as inferior and flawed. And it’s not just confined to India; even in other international cricket teams, such as Afghanistan, this sort of behaviour is notably absent. Afghan cricketers get a warm reception from Indian cricket fans.\\n\\nHence, those who argued that there is Islamophobia and hatred behind the chant ‘Jai Shree Ram’ should take a look at the New Delhi cricket match between India and Afghanistan. The celebration of Afghani team’s Rashid Khan and the genuine love he received from Indians, as the crowd cheered for him, is a testament to how India embraces him as one of its own sons.\\n\\nI refrain from naming over 100 Muslim players who have played for the Indian cricket team as doing so would be a sign of disrespect for the nation. This is in stark contrast to a neighbouring State where even the rarest of rare cases, such as Hindu cricketer Danish Kaneria, face relentless targeting for their faith by their team members on a daily basis.\\n\\nLet’s maintain a balanced perspective and assess things objectively, without letting Leftists and Communists guilt-trip the average Indian.\\n\\nSorry Pakistan, I am not sorry.\\n\\nAmana Begam Ansari is a columnist and TV news panelist.

       " {'articleBody': 'The 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel will have oil market repercussions if the conflict widens to include Hezbollah or Iran. There will likely be calls to ratchet up sanctions enforcement on Iranian oil exports, which have increased in the past 6 months. Normalization talks between Saudi Arabia and Israel could be suspended amid deepening Israel/Palestinian conflict, closing off an important avenue of US/Saudi cooperation. A key issue to watch in the weeks and months to come is whether disrupted oil supplies from Iran or a sustained oil price increase will alter Saudi Arabia’s plans to unwind its production cuts.\\n\\nQ: What was the immediate market impact?\\n\\nA: Brent crude prices rose to nearly $89 per barrel when Asian markets opened on 9 October, before settling back a bit. Front-month Brent prices had dropped the week before by some 11% from their late September peak, but oil prices have now regained some of that ground. However, the price bounce was relatively limited, suggesting that, for now, the market is not concerned about a major disruption to either supply or demand. Any conflict in the Middle East can create a geopolitical risk premium, but a more dramatic price impact may not materialize unless the conflict draws in other states and non-state actors. Israel has negligible oil output but is a sizeable natural gas producer. Following the attack, the country suspended production at its offshore Tamar gas field, which supplies the domestic market as well as Jordan and Egypt. Israel’s energy ministry noted that, if necessary, it could declare a state of emergency that would allow the government to allocate natural gas to various consumers in the event of supply shortages.\\n\\nQ: What would increase the oil market impact?\\n\\nA: Iran would be the vector for a broader market impact. So far, US and Israeli officials have avoided blaming Iran for direct involvement in Hamas’ unprecedented attacks on Israeli civilians and military installations. But, for years, Iran has supported both Hamas and Hezbollah to pressure Israel on multiple fronts as part of its “axis of resistance.” If evidence surfaces that Iran provided material or financial support for Hamas’ attacks, one obvious way to exact a toll is to ratchet up enforcement of sanctions on Iran’s oil exports. Between May and September of this year, Iran’s crude oil and condensate exports averaged some 1.4 million B/D, returning to levels not seen in at least 4 years. There is a widespread perception in the oil market that the United States has relaxed its sanctions enforcement on Iran as it negotiated over last month’s release of several political prisoners, among other issues. The uptick in Iran’s oil exports since May helped to offset deep production cuts by Saudi Arabia and other producers. If stronger sanctions enforcement curtails Iranian volumes in the fourth quarter of this year, anticipated supply deficits could grow even wider.\\n\\nRead the full story here.',\n",

The Nifty50 index dropped 247 points, or 1.4 per cent, to settle at 18,875 – the lowest level since June 27. Thursday’s session was the worst for both the indices since March 13.\\n\\nThe yield on the 10-year US Treasury hovered close to the 5 per cent mark, dampening the appetite for equities. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold domestic shares worth Rs 7,703 crore on Thursday. The selling was partly offset by buying to the tune of Rs 6,558 crore by domestic institutions. FPIs have pulled out nearly Rs 23,000 crore from domestic equities so far this month.\\n\\nU R Bhat, co-founder of Alphaniti Fintech, said high US bond yields meant that the bond market was expecting further tightening. “If US 10-year bonds are giving 5 per cent on a risk-adjusted basis, no market, including India, is giving that kind of return. And FPIs would rather take that 5 per cent, especially when they are sitting on decent returns from Indian equities,” Bhat said.\\n\\n“The current level of FPI selling can be managed with domestic flows, but if it doubles or triples, then we are in trouble,” he added.\\n\\n“The real fall in Indian equities may occur when domestic investors will also think on those lines and sell,” Bhat said.\\n\\nIn the past six trading sessions, the Nifty and the Sensex have tumbled nearly 5 per cent. The 10-year US bond yield has hardened by 13 basis points to 4.97 per cent during this period. India’s market cap has dropped by Rs 17.8 trillion to Rs 306 trillion.\\n\\nFears of the Israel-Hamas conflict snowballing into a regional stalemate involving Iran and other oil-producing countries have also continued to rattle investors.\\n\\nOn Thursday, an Israeli army statement said it took part in an overnight “targeted raid” as it prepared for a ground invasion.

Crude oil prices pose an additional risk to India as it imports more than three-fourths of its requirement.\\n\\n“There is no sign of easing of tensions. As long as there is no progress on de-escalation, investors are likely to think of the worst. Everyone is rushing to the exit, and that is reflected in stock prices,” said Bhat.\\n\\nThe decline in US tech majors and some other multinational giants due to either reporting weaker-than-expected earnings or acknowledging the impact of an uncertain environment added to the overall gloom.

       " {'articleBody': 'At a time when the world is already grappling with high interest rates and inflation, the war between Israel and Hamas is adding fuel to the fire of rising crude prices. As a result, it may put additional burden on countries like India that are susceptible to imported inflation.\\n\\nMarket watchers believe the impact of the war on the markets is likely to be soft, but not nil. Anand Shah, Head of PMS and AIF Investments at ICICI Prudential AMC, says, “The long-term impact of the Israel-Hamas war on Indian equity markets is likely to be muted. But, it is marginally negative in the short-term, considering the country’s dependency on imported oil and gas”. Per CMIE’s Economic Outlook, petroleum products accounted for nearly 30 per cent of India’s total import bill in FY23; it stood at 27.53 per cent in FY20.\\n\\nShah adds that if the conflict escalates and energy prices remain high, it could keep inflation high, leading to increased interest rates for longer. Elevated inflation for longer can potentially depress equity market valuations globally.\\n\\nDomestically, the benchmark BSE Sensex declined 0.56 per cent, or 366 points, to close at 65,629.24 on October 19, 2023 from 65,995.63 on October 6. Meanwhile, crude oil prices climbed over 9 per cent to $92.4 per barrel between October 6 and 19.\\n\\nSunny Agrawal, Head of the Fundamental Research Desk at SBI Securities, believes central bankers globally—who are struggling to contain high inflation, and the narrative of “high crude prices stoke inflation, and engender higher-for-longer interest rates”—have made investors nervous about their next move.\\n\\nAgrawal says that for India—that imports around 80 per cent of its crude requirements—any spike in crude prices (above $95 per barrel) may put pressure on oil marketing companies. “High crude prices also stoke inflationary pressure on sectors like cement, paints, airlines, chemicals,” he says, adding that the ongoing conflicts also have the potential to push defence budgets across the world. “Domestic defence firms are likely to be the key beneficiaries,” he says.\\n\\nThere are also fears that the recent hostilities may impact various sectors, including railways, ports, oil and gas, and aviation in the medium-term if the situation persists. For instance, the planned implementation of the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC) by sea and rail route might face delays, and impact domestic firms too. “Several domestic railway players were supposed to bag a large chunk of orders for the creation of the mammoth rail infrastructure. Significant delay in the implementation of the project could potentially hamper the earnings growth prospects for railway players in the medium-term,” says Agrawal.\\n\\n@iamrahuloberoi',\n",

No further information was given.\\n\\nLi is the second senior Chinese official to disappear this year, following former Foreign Minister Qin Gang, who was removed from office in July with no explanation offered.\\n\\nLi, who became defense minister during a Cabinet reshuffle in March, hasn’t been seen since giving a speech on Aug. 29. There is no indication that the disappearances of Qin and Li signal a change in China’s foreign or defense policies, although they have raised questions about the resilience of president and ruling Communist Party leader Xi Jinping’s circle of power.\\n\\nXi has a reputation for valuing loyalty above all and has relentlessly attacked corruption in public and private, sometimes in what has been seen as a method of eliminating political rivals and shoring up his political position amid a deteriorating economy and rising tensions with U.S. over trade, technology and Taiwan.\\n\\nLi is under U.S. sanctions related to his overseeing weapon purchases from Russia that bar him from entering the country. China has since cut off contacts with the U.S. military, mainly in protest over U.S. arm sales to Taiwan, but also strongly implying that Washington must lift the measures against Li, which Beijing refuses to publicly recognize.\\n\\nThe announcement from state broadcaster CCTV said that both Li and Qin had been removed from the State Council, China's Cabinet and the center of government power. That virtually assures the end of their political careers, although it remains unclear whether they will face prosecution or other legal sanctions.\\n\\nCCTV also announced Lan Fo’an's new appointment as finance minister, and Yin He’jun as science and technology minister.\\n\\nChina's political and legal systems remain highly opaque, fueling lively discussion of possible corruption, personal foibles or fallings-out with other powerful figures leading to the downfall of top officials.\\n\\nAlong with dealing with what appear to be internal political issues, the ruling party is struggling to revive an economy that has been severely impacted by the draconian “zero-Covid” measures, an aging population, high unemployment among college graduates and a movement of many of its wealthiest and best educated to more liberal societies abroad.\\n\\nHaving had his ideology, known as “Xi Jinping Thought,” enshrined in the party constitution and with the abolishment of presidential term limits, Xi has structured the system so that he may stay in power for the rest of his life.

In the current scenario, supports are appearing very fragile and vulnerable,” Mr. De said. “Despite the recent sharp decline, further correction from the current level seems highly possible,” he added.\\n\\nAnalysts fear that there could be a further slowdown in the global economy in case oil prices go out of control due to the latest geopolitical tensions that also have the potential to disrupt supply chains, a grim reminder of the effects of the Russia-Ukraine war.',\n",

Among those facing the dire sentence is Commander Sugunakar Pakala (retd). The verdict, shrouded in uncertainty and allegations, has ignited a wave of anguish among the families of the accused, as they grapple with the distressing turn of events.\\n\\nKalyan Chakraborty, the brother-in-law of former Navy Commander Sugunakar Pakala, shared his profound sorrow upon hearing the verdict from Qatar. Speaking to Republic in a telephonic conversation, Chakraborty remarked, \"First thing is without proving what fault they have done, this is very injustice. From last 14 months all 8 naval officers\\' families have been suffering. They are trying to punish all innocent officers, in which one is a presidential awardee.\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nExpressing his bewilderment at the sudden change in the narrative surrounding the case, Chakraborty questioned, \"Yesterday, they changed the scenario, claiming that these individuals were attempting to spy for Israel.

And sending to death is something of very shocking news.\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhen asked whether the family got any consular and legal assistance so far in connection with the case, he said, \"The embassy is with us, the govt is with us.\"\\n\\nHe also revealed the distressing condition of Commander Pakala\\'s wife, stating, \"My sister is in shock and her health is completely down from yesterday. Seeing her health, we all are literally… matlab aisa lagta hai ki hume bhi le ja kar wahi dafna dein to accha hai. Bina Jija ji ke mere behen aur bacche kya karenge?

He said, Commodore BK Verma is a NDA cadet. He has been a forthright officer whose integrity was impeccable. His Espionage has come as a shock. The present verdict is disturbing and one hopes that our country will be able to do something about it.”\\n\\nSupporting the Indian government he said, “We will rally behind our country irrespective of the fact that we are serving or retired. We stand behind Indian Government on this. We were given assurance by Indian Navy that they will make sure that Commander Birender K Verma and other eight colleagues will be released soon.\\'\\'\\n\\nTalking about the personal help to Commander Verma, his coursemate said, “In Indian Defence forces, many children do not see their father as they serve in forward areas.

       " {'articleBody': \"The oil price rally has failed to gain any kind of momentum three weeks after tensions in the Middle East escalated despite market fundamentals strengthening. Brent crude for December delivery was down 1.8% to trade at $88.49 per barrel at 1400 hrs ET in Thursday’s intraday session while the December WTI contract fell by a similar margin to change hands at $83.88 per barrel. Brent has now declined 7.0% over the past week while WTI is down 4.8% over the timeframe as worries about the global economy and energy demand weighed on sentiment.\\n\\nOil prices have been a rollercoaster over the past couple of months as negative catalysts frequently outshine the positive ones and vice-versa. In recent times, fears of a spillover in the conflict between Israel and Hamas, which could embroil Iran and its allies in the region, have offered considerable support to oil prices. However, the U.S. and other countries have been urging Israel to delay a full invasion of Gaza, which the Middle East nation has so far complied with.\\n\\nMeanwhile, global oil supply has continued tightening despite record production by U.S. shale. The latest Energy Information Administration (EIA) weekly data was highly bullish with crude oil inventories falling 4.49 mb to 419.75 mb, taking the deficit below the five-year average to 20.91 mb. Crude oil inventories in the WTI pricing hub at Cushing, Oklahoma, fell 0.76 mb to a nine-year low of 21.01 mb. Meanwhile, gasoline inventories fell 2.37 mb to 223.90 mb, thereby cutting the surplus above the five-year average to just 0.40 mb. Implied demand improved significantly w/w, with total demand climbing 2.231 mb/d to 21.897 mb/d and gasoline demand rising 362 kb/d to 8.943 mb/d. Gasoline demand for October-to-date stands at 8.792 mb/d, a mere 0.2% Y/Y contraction and good for a sharp improvement from the 5.6% decline Recorded in September. Gasoline demand is 0.4% higher in the year-to-date.\\n\\nRelated: Warren Buffet Snaps Up More Occidental Petroleum\\n\\nEven better, commodity analysts are predicting that oil markets will continue to tighten for the rest of the year.\\n\\nCommodity analysts at Standard Chartered have predicted a further 120 mb reduction in global inventories in Q4, on top of the 172 mb reduction in Q3. The experts expect the rate of inventory draw to accelerate from 0.52 mb/d in October to 1.38 mb/d in November and 1.99 mb/d in December. StanChart says it’s possible that the current dominance of Middle East headline trading has led to lower prices by distracting the market from both falling inventories and from producer policies aimed at achieving a soft landing for the market at higher price levels. In other words, the recent tendency towards higher prices with lower volatility has been replaced by a downwards drift with higher volatility.\\n\\nThat’s a remarkable trend considering surging U.S. production. Data by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows that U.S. crude production grew 0.7% to 12.99 million barrels per day (bpd) in July, its highest since November 2019, when production hit a peak of 13 million bpd. Texas production grew 1.3% to 5.6 million bpd in July, its highest on record; North Dakota's output increased 1.2% to 1.2 million bpd while production from New Mexico climbed 0.6% to 1.8 million bpd.\\n\\nThe demand side of the equation is equally encouraging. According toStanChart, global oil demand has already exceeded the pre-Covid oil demand set in August 2019, averaging 102.33 million barrels per day (mb/d), good for a m/m increase of 1.2 mb/d and a y/y increase of 2.3 mb/d. The analysts have refuted arguments by some Wall Street analysts that high oil prices have already triggered demand destruction.\\n\\nUnderpricing Middle East Risk\\n\\nLast week, Standard Chartered pointed to a medium-term reduction in Iranian oil exports as being the most likely consequence of shifts in the geopolitical landscape. It’s not a far-fetched notion either: last week, the Biden administration slapped new tariffs on Iran due to its ballistic missile and drone programs.\\n\\nBack in August, we reported that Iran's oil exports had hit record highs thanks in large part to the Biden administration opting to look the other way as Tehran boosts production ostensibly in a bid to keep markets well supplied and oil prices low. The price response to the escalation in the Middle East tensions has so far been modest; however, the Israel-Gaza war is likely to cause a significant shift in U.S. policy on Iran due to its open support and backing for Hamas.\\n\\nConstraints on Iranian oil exports were eased after the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015 but tightened again after the U.S. withdrew from the JCPOA during the Trump administration, with output falling below 2 mb/d in 2020 when waivers given to consuming countries were withdrawn. Iran’s oil output and exports have increased sharply under the Biden administration, with production hitting 3 mb/d, including 500,000 b/d in the current year, while exports sit just under 2 mb/d.\\n\\nStanChart says that changes in positioning in the oil futures markets have been modest despite a significant increase in volatility. The analysts note that it is not an extreme tail of the distribution as might be expected in a full-blown Middle East crisis, adding that speculative positioning is also not extreme, particularly in Brent. The latest fund manager data shows that prices are about USD 6 per barrel (bbl) lower than in late September, despite no significant loosening in fundamentals. StanChart says that the Middle East geopolitical risk is currently being significantly under-priced and that current fundamentals alone are enough to justify a complete reversal of this month’s price undershooting.\\n\\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\\n\\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\",\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'The FTC has been conducting its own review of the merger, which would combine the two biggest traditional supermarket chains in the U.S.\\n\\nThe U.S. FTC continues to pursue legal action in its own administrative hearing.\\n\\nA “super cycle” of cyber attacks and responses due to artificial intelligence will spawn a flurry of deals in the future.\\n\\n“Administrative applications are getting a lot more attention now,” says VSS Principal Eric Kim. “The clinical side is longer-term.”\\n\\nEven for the near-term administrative side, though, AI strictly speaking is still in its infancy and it’s premature to speak of M&A activity, adds Kim, a former Optum managing director.\\n\\n“There is a lot of funding activity,” he says, to develop AI so that it can start supporting healthcare activities and increase value for PE investors.\\n\\nRackspace Technology, a cloud computing company, has a portfolio of companies working on AI applications. For Nand Sharma, a vice president who helps healthcare companies in their digital challenges, the most immediate application for the technology is to make the ecosystem – providers, payers, patients – more efficient in everything from scheduling appointments to paying bills.\\n\\n“Right now, you can wait for months to get an appointment,” Sharma notes. AI technology will enable patients to navigate the system more efficiently, managing a patient’s profile and assembling historical data quickly. This will mean savings not only in dollar terms, but in time.\\n\\nLonger term, AI can support clinical diagnosis, starting perhaps by helping analyze imaging like MRIs, Kim suggests. However, it will take longer both for doctors and patients to become comfortable with a greater role for AI in diagnosis.\\n\\n“There’s often been a black-box nature to diagnosis,” he says. Datasets will have to become larger and clearer, and there will have a lot of explaining involved.\\n\\n“Doctors’ hesitancy in adopting is understandable. It’s more high stakes, and that is appropriate.”\\n\\nRackspace Technology’s Sharma sees long-term potential. “Tomorrow, providers will be able to provide surgeries over long distance,” he says. “Simple diagnoses can be done without doctors.”\\n\\nHe also calls attention to the scope for AI to help with post-merger integration, an important factor in growing value once new technologies have been acquired.\\n\\nIn any case, the industry is seizing on the new technology for the possibilities it opens up. Healthcare as a sector is largely exempt from economic ups and downs.\\n\\nNEXT WEEK:\\n\\nEverything, Everywhere, All AI At Once\\n\\n“People are always getting sick, people are always getting older,” says Adam Birnbaum, executive director and dealmaker at GP Bullhound, an investment banking boutique. “Healthcare is not subject to the vagaries of the broader economy.”\\n\\nThe healthcare sector accounts for roughly a fifth of U.S. GDP, Birnbaum says. “Across the board, investment continues strong,” he says.\\n\\nBecause it is often literally a matter of life and death, healthcare gets more government scrutiny. The Federal Trade Commission has made a point of examining hospital mergers, in particular, for geographical concentration that could limit patient accessibility. And because healthcare is so personal, it has numerous rules regarding privacy.\\n\\nBirnbaum sees potential for AI applications in the pharmaceutical industry, as the technology can sift through mountains of potential treatments to identify the most promising ones, and then help identify and locate potential participants in clinical trials.\\n\\nDrug companies that are looking for one in a thousand molecules to develop into Phase I trials will have help. “Using AI, they can be smarter about datasets,” he says. The average cost of commercializing a drug has risen to $2.2 billion as costs have doubled, Birnbaum says, and anything that can help reduce that cost would make it more accessible to patients.\\n\\nThis M&A veteran thinks artificial intelligence is something of a misnomer to describe how the technology can improve systems and processes. Generative AI will be able to identify new applications for existing drugs, revamp existing supply chains, and locate availability of needed treatments, among other functions, he says.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Birnbaum expects to see enormous savings in efficiency gains in back office and billing applications. The current rate of errors in payments alone contributes to “exorbitant” medical expenses, he says.\\n\\nPayers have a simple principle, Sharma notes – “the maximum amount of result for the minimum amount of payment.” As Kim adds, AI has a role in helping payers better manage costs.\\n\\nManaging data will become more effective, says Sharma, as it “gets cleaned up” through AI. New technologies will go deeper to identify targets and patients for clinical trials – and make them safer. “We want to have clinical trials, but we want them to be safe,” he says. A more data-driven approach will also lead to more accountability, he feels.\\n\\nFor now, it is the tech giants that are propelling AI uses in healthcare. Microsoft and its speech recognition subsidiary, Nuance Communications, have partnered with Epic to use generative AI tools for medical note-taking, freeing physicians from the onerous task of transcribing clinical notes. Amazon has introduced its AWS HealthScribe for a similar purpose.\\n\\nSee all of our coverage on artificial intelligence in M&A.\\n\\nPE investors in the lower middle market nonetheless are looking for promising firms to add to their portfolios and increase valuations over a five to seven-year period. “I don’t see it being that different,” says VSS’s Kim of investing in healthcare technology. “We are looking for technology and tech-enabled services” in line with the VSS philosophy of providing flexible growth capital.\\n\\nThe goal, Kim explains, is often to get companies to the stage where big companies want to acquire them. AI is at such an early stage, that PE firms may wait to invest in them. Estimates of the compound annual growth rate for AI in healthcare by the end of the decade sometimes reach 40 percent or more.\\n\\nThe role of PEs, in short, remains the same. “Private equity helps companies become more advanced so they will sell at a higher value,” says Sharma. “There’s a huge play on the AI side.”\\n\\nSome investments have already been made. Medical device maker Medtronic last year announced a $75 million investment in CathWorks, a privately-held Israeli company innovating in diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease.\\n\\nMedtronic will begin immediately co-promoting CathWorks’ FFRangio System, which uses AI in the U.S., Europe and Japan. In a separate agreement, Medtronic has an option to acquire the Israeli firm for $585 million through mid-2027 if certain milestones are met.\\n\\nOn the PE side, Blackford Capital in June announced its acquisition of PACIV, an industrial technology firm serving manufacturers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical sectors. Blackford plans to use PACIV as a platform for further investments as the technology firm uses an emergent form of artificial intelligence to streamline operations.\\n\\nSharma’s company in June launched Foundry for Generative AI by Rackspace to accelerate adoption of the technology across industries. It draws on existing platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure and applies their data to address specific uses.\\n\\nSays Sharma, “The sky’s the limit for the technology.”',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'The media firestorm over whether Israel attacked the al-Ahli hospital in Gaza is over. It was an errant rocket shot by the Iran-backed Islamic Jihad group that exploded near the compound. But another media firestorm is brewing, and it will focus squarely on the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. Al-Shifa is the largest hospital in Gaza. It is also, according to numerous and credible reports, a Hamas base of military operations.\\n\\nThe specifics have been revealed in a steady drip of open-source information dating back to 2006, when a PBS documentary showed Hamas fighters roaming Shifa’s halls, intimidating staff, and denying access to parts of the hospital. The following year, according to Human Rights Watch, Hamas fired at its rival group Fatah from within the Shifa hospital compound during a Palestinian civil war. As one doctor said, “the medical staff are suffering from fear and terror, particularly of the Hamas fighters, who are in every corner of the hospital.”\\n\\nIn 2008, the year that marked the first rocket war between Hamas and Israel, the New York Times noted that Hamas was operating openly within the hospital, and that members of the group murdered a patient there. One Times report stated that the Hamas leadership was located in a bunker under the hospital’s burn ward, while the group fired rockets from areas near the hospital, in an effort to deter an Israeli response. The following year, the Times cited Yuval Diskin, the former head of Israel’s internal security services (Shin Bet), who said Hamas leadership was holed up in a bunker below building number 2 of Shifa Hospital.\\n\\nAvi Dichter, another former head of the Shin Bet, stated in 2009 that Hamas’s operations in Shifa was an open secret. It was such an open secret that Hamas operative Rami Misbah Abed-Rabbo admitted himself that Hamas took over a large bunker under Shifa during the war with Israel in 2008.\\n\\nDuring the 2014 war between Hamas and Israel, multiple credible media outlets reported on the Hamas operations in the Gaza hospital. The Washington Post reported that Shifa was a “de facto headquarters” for Hamas. Wall Street Journal reporter Nick Casey tweeted an image of a Hamas spokesman giving an interview at a Gaza hospital, saying, “You have to wonder … how patients at Shifa hospital feel as Hamas uses it as a safe place to see media.” The tweet was later deleted. Similarly, Palestinian journalist Radjaa Abou Dagga wrote about how Hamas used Shifa for military purposes, but then sought to remove the article, fearing for his family’s safety.\\n\\nAn open source intelligence report also published in Israel that year cited Palestinian sources who noted that Hamas used Shifa’s x-ray department as a jail and interrogation facility. An Amnesty International report the following year cited evidence of Hamas torturing and killing prisoners in Shifa.\\n\\nIn the course of my own research on Hamas over the last 10 years, multiple Israeli officials across multiple government agencies have confirmed the existence of a Hamas command center below the Shifa hospital. The group is believed to have constructed significant infrastructure well beneath the ground. This includes an operations room that effectively serves as the eyes and ears of Hamas across the Gaza Strip, with direct and secure lines to the Iranian regime, Hezbollah, other state patrons, and nonstate partners.\\n\\nSince the Hamas attack of October 7, Israel has warned that it plans to destroy all Hamas infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. In private conversations with former Israeli officials, I have heard Shifa mentioned multiple times. Nobody has stated that Israel is preparing to destroy the command center. But the implication is not hard to miss.\\n\\nA ground invasion might lead to Israeli forces working to clear the compound, floor by floor, room by room. However, such a battle would put Israeli forces at a disadvantage. If given a choice, Israel would almost certainly elect to destroy the command center by air. This would, of course, mean additional misery for the beleaguered people of Gaza.\\n\\nThere is a legal term for what Hamas is doing. It is using the medical staff and patients as “human shields” to protect Hamas terrorists from lawful attack. Doing so is a war crime, prohibited by the international law of armed conflict.\\n\\nThe United Nations and governments worldwide have condemned the use of human shields. However, none of these actors have come forth yet to condemn Hamas for using al-Shifa as a military headquarters.\\n\\nThe coming battle over Shifa promises to be intense. The Israeli, American, and other governments should reveal what is known about the Hamas presence there right now. Hamas must be pressured to vacate if tragedy is to be averted.\\n\\nOf course, this is easier said than done. Hamas is defiant as Israel prepares for a ground invasion now. Still, the coming standoff need not lead to the destruction of the Shifa hospital. Rather, Israel should continue to clear the northern Gaza Strip and even bombard the entire area surrounding Shifa once civilians have been evacuated. When it is safe for Israeli forces to enter, they should surround the hospital and demand that unconditional surrender of the Hamas leadership still holed up inside.\\n\\nThis is a drama that should play out in front of the entire world. Should Hamas refuse to surrender after a period of days or even weeks, Israel should carefully enter the compound. The first goal must be to defend the lives of all patients and doctors inside. But, when all is said and done, Israel must emerge from this compound with photos, videos, captured weapons, and other evidence of Hamas military activities that took place under the hospital.\\n\\nMany critics of Israel have questioned whether a ground invasion could end Hamas. It’s a fair question. There may not be a military solution on its own. But military operations supplemented with damning evidence that Hamas has held the Gaza Strip hostage could prove to be a dramatic moment that swings world opinion against the Iran-backed terrorist organization, once and for all.',\n",

So far the fighting has not led to a supply interruption.Fossil fuel prices are down from 2022 peaks, but \"markets are tense and volatile,\" said the IEA in the report.\"Some of the immediate pressures from the global energy crisis have eased, but energy markets, geopolitics, and the global economy are unsettled and the risk of further disruption is ever present,\" it said.Birol pointed out that there was \"a major government response\" to the energy supply concerns that arose 50 years ago from the Arab oil embargo imposed during the 1973 Yom Kippur war.It sent oil prices nearly 300% higher and led to the founding of the IEA in 1974 to help shape a collective response to the disruption. That was followed by the 1978 Iranian revolution, which added another price shock. At the time, the solutions included the rollout of nuclear power plants and the imposition of mileage standards for cars.\"This time, we have all of the available technologies,\" Birol said. \"We have solar, wind, nuclear power, electric cars. They will extend significantly around the world and it will be an additional boost to the energy transition.\"He pointed to the rapid rollout of electric cars, saying that in 2020 only one in 25 cars was electric but in 2023 it was one in five. Meanwhile the share of fossil fuels in electricity generation has fallen from 70% ten years ago to 60% today and should reach 40% by 2030, he said.Concerted international action at the upcoming United Nations climate conference is needed to expand use of clean technologies and find new ways of financing the massive investment that is needed, especially in the developing world, the IEA said.The report also pointed to a shifting role for China, once a leading source of increased demand for energy due to rapid industrialization and growth. The report said energy demand there could peak as soon as 2025 amid slowing growth and \"impressive\" shifts to clean energy like solar and nuclear.The IEA estimates that demand for fossil fuels will peak before 2030 under current policies but says governments will have to increase their efforts to speed up the transition if the world is to meet the global goal of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Giannis Antetokounmpo has indicated on social media that he has agreed to a contract extension with the Milwaukee Bucks.\\n\\nAntetokounmpo issued a social media post on Monday that said, \"MILWAUKEEEEEEEEE!! Let\\'s get it!!!! #BucksInSix #Extended.\" The post came as ESPN reported that the two-time MVP had agreed on a three-year extension worth $186 million, with a player option for the 2027-28 season.\\n\\nThe Bucks didn\\'t make an official announcement, but they reposted Antetokounmpo\\'s post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. The Bucks\\' repost, which was later deleted, included the message, \"The best possible cure for the Mondays.\"\\n\\nAntetokounmpo\\'s announcement came as Minnesota’s Jaden McDaniels, Washington’s Deni Avdija and Orlando’s Cole Anthony led the first wave of fourth-year players to reach agreements on contract extensions ahead of the NBA’s deadline.\\n\\nAntetokounmpo had said this summer that he didn’t plan to sign an extension this year because it would make more financial sense for him to wait until the summer. The two-time MVP also had indicated that he wanted to wait to see how committed the Bucks were toward winning another title before he decided on whether to sign an extension on his contract, which at the time ran through 2024-25 with a player option for 2025-26.\\n\\nSince then, the Bucks made a blockbuster trade to acquire seven-time all-NBA guard Damian Lillard from the Portland Trail Blazers. Even after that trade, Antetokounmpo had indicated he didn’t expect to sign an extension this year.\\n\\n“I said that it did not make sense to sign the contract right now because money’s not important — a lot of money is important. So I’m going to sign it next year,” Antetokounmpo said with a laugh during the Bucks’ Media Day event on Oct. 2. “But, no, at the end of the day, again, it doesn’t make sense. It does not make sense for me to sign it right now. I’ve got to always look at what’s best for me and my family, for my situation.\\n\\n“But at the end of the day, I want to be a Milwaukee Buck for the rest of my career, as long as we are winning. It’s as simple as that.”\\n\\nThe extension starts with the 2025-26 season, meaning Antetokounmpo is under contract for at least four more years — and a fifth if he’s so inclined. He will earn about $94.4 million over the next two seasons, then about $120 million more for the 2025-26 and 2026-27 seasons.\\n\\nThe last year is at his option, meaning he could make roughly $66 million more in 2027-28.\\n\\nAnd if Antetokounmpo had waited until next summer to agree to an extension, he possibly may have secured earned even more money. A max-extension scenario had he waited until 2024 could have been a four-year agreement at a figure exceeding $250 million.\\n\\nAs far as the extensions involving fourth-year players, agent Bill Duffy confirmed that McDaniels and the Timberwolves agreed on a five-year, $136 million extension. The 28th overall pick in 2020, who came to Minnesota in the same draft as star Anthony Edwards, had a breakout third season with an average of 12.1 points per game on 51.7% shooting.\\n\\nWith three maximum contract players on the roster in Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert, the Timberwolves have committed themselves to the luxury tax range with their salary cap. But the 6-foot-9 McDaniels is the team\\'s best defender and one of the league\\'s best shutdown wings, and the Timberwolves believe he has untapped offensive potential to pair with his defensive ability.\\n\\n“I feel like, shoot, I can go out and score 25 points every night if I wanted to,” McDaniels said at the beginning of training camp.\\n\\nThe Timberwolves open their season at Toronto on Wednesday. McDaniels currently has a calf injury, putting his status for the game in doubt.\\n\\nAvdija agreed to a four-year, $55 million extension with the Wizards, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team hadn\\'t announced the agreement. The 22-year-old Avdija started a career-high 40 games last season and averaged 9.2 points and 6.4 rebounds. Washington drafted him in the first round in 2020.\\n\\nAvdija is somewhat remarkably the longest-tenured player on the Wizards. They traded Bradley Beal to Phoenix in the offseason and enter 2023-24 with a significantly different roster. Avdija, a 6-foot-9 forward from Israel, has averaged 8.1 points in 212 career games since the Wizards made him the ninth overall pick in the 2020 draft.\\n\\nAnthony and the Magic agreed to a three-year, $39 million extension, which the team announced Monday. The son of 11-year NBA veteran Greg Anthony, he was the 15th overall pick in the 2020 draft.\\n\\nThe point guard missed more than a month last season with an oblique muscle injury and saw his scoring average drop by more than three points per game. After starting all 65 games he played in during the 2021-22 season with Markelle Fultz sidelined by injury, Anthony returned to a role off the bench once Fultz was back in the starting lineup.\\n\\nBut Anthony shot a career-best 45.4% from the field, including 36.4% from 3-point range, and reduced his turnovers by an average of more than one per game.\\n\\nElsewhere, the San Antonio Spurs announced a multiyear extension for center Zach Collins. The 10th overall pick in the 2017 draft averaged a career-high 11.6 points per game last season.\\n\\nAlso, the Atlanta Hawks signed forward-center Onyeka Okongwu to a four-year, $62 million rookie contract extension.\\n\\nOkongwu has started in 28 of 178 career games, averaging 7.9 points and 5.7 rebounds. He could play a larger role this season, following the trade of power forward John Collins to Utah.\\n\\nThe deal with Okongwu came after the team exercised the fourth-year contract option on forward Jalen Johnson and the third-year option on guard AJ Griffin.\\n\\nThe Dallas Mavericks and Josh Green agreed on a $41 million, three-year contract extension coming off the most productive of the guard’s three seasons.\\n\\nNews of the deal comes two days before the Mavericks open the regular season in San Antonio, with Green set to see how he fits with a retooled roster around stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.\\n\\nA first-round draft pick in 2020, Green has provided energy and athleticism off the bench, with more of an impact in 2022-23 than the Australian’s first two seasons.\\n\\nGreen, who turns 23 next month, missed 20 games with a right elbow sprain last season but still started a career-high 21 games while averaging 9.1 points and 3.0 rebounds.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds and AP Sports Writers Dave Campbell, Steve Megargee and Charles Odum contributed to this report.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\\n\\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

       " {'articleBody': 'Over a month after the New Yorker’s profile on him, Hasan Minhaj has responded to the piece in which he admitted to fabricating parts of his stand-up act. His response comes in the form of a 20-minute video that contains recordings from the original New Yorker profile.\\n\\n“To everyone who read that article,” Minhaj said in the video, which you can watch above, “I want to answer the biggest question that’s probably on your mind: Is Hasan Minhaj secretly a psycho?”\\n\\n“I’m not a psycho. But this New Yorker article definitely made me look like one,” the comedian continued. “It was so needlessly misleading, not just about my stand-up, but also about me as a person. The truth is, racism, FBI surveillance and the threats to my family happened. And I said this on the record.”\\n\\nThe comedian also explained why he “took a beat before responding” to the article that came out on Sept. 15, saying that “like you, I’ve been paralyzed by the news coming out of the Middle East. I have been processing all the criticism that’s come my way.” Hamas’ attack on Israel happened Oct. 7.\\n\\nMinhaj then proceeded to do what he calls “the most Hasan Minhaj thing ever” and launched into a deep dive into his own scandal complete with graphics. Specifically, he focused on three exaggerated stories that were highlighted in the New Yorker article: being rejected by his prom date due to his race, getting slammed on a car by an undercover F.B.I. informant who infiltrated Minhaj’s community mosque and the anthrax scare he had in his home that allegedly led to his daughter going to the hospital.\\n\\nOnce again, Minhaj admitted that the latter two — and far more serious — stories were exaggerated.\\n\\nThe comedian said he gave the New Yorker “so much evidence that they ignored” when it comes to these three stories. Most of that evidence is related to the prom story. Though Minhaj said in the video that “I don’t give a s–t about prom,” a third of the 21-minute video is devoted to the incident.\\n\\nThe first piece of evidence Minhaj provided to counteract the New Yorker article are emails from “Bethany,” the white woman who rejected Minhaj from prom allegedly due to his race. In both the New Yorker’s account and in Minhaj’s defense, the comedian admits his rejection did not happen on her doorstep as claimed in his special “Homecoming King” but days before, a detail the woman in question corroborates.\\n\\nMinhaj said the New Yorker’s account “makes it sound like I got friend-zoned by Bethany and then I turned into an angry incel and faked racism to get back at her.” To prove this rejection was due to his race and not due to differing accounts, he leaked emails from “Bethany” after her marriage to an Indian American man that were sent in 2015. In one of her responses, she wrote, “I think my parents have come a long way, too,” a detail Minhaj pointed to as proof that her and her parents’ rejection of him originally stemmed from racism.\\n\\nMinhaj also disputed “Bethany’s” claim that he invited her to an Off Broadway performance of “Homecoming King” to “humiliate her” and that he insufficiently disguised her identity. In the New Yorker article, she claimed this led to personal threats and being doxxed. As proof he was not to blame for this doxxing, he provided emails in which he said he put “Bethany” in contact with fact checkers from “This American Life,” invited her to the Netflix press party and asked her to delete a social media post that could possibly reveal her identity.\\n\\nThe other two stories Minhaj defends are far graver than a prom date gone wrong. In both cases he admitted to embellishing stories in his stand-up act and apologized to audiences.\\n\\n“Hasan Minhaj confirms in this video that he selectively presents information and embellishes to make a point: exactly what we reported,” the New Yorker said in a statement. “Our piece, which includes Minhaj’s perspective at length, was carefully reported and fact-checked. It is based on interviews with more than 20 people, including former ‘Patriot Act’ and ‘Daily Show’ staffers; members of Minhaj’s security team; and people who have been the subject of his stand-up work, including the former F.B.I. informant ‘Brother Eric’ and the woman at the center of his prom-rejection story. We stand by our story.”\\n\\nIn his special “The King’s Jester” Minhaj tells the story of Brother Eric, an F.B.I. informant who gains the trust of his mosque community and slams the comedian on the roof of a car after Minhaj messes with him. Both in the New Yorker article and in his defense, Minhaj admitted that Brother Eric wasn’t real and he was not Craig Monteilh, the real-life informant who spied on Islamic communities and whom Minhaj claims harassed him as a teenager. Instead, he said the character was an amalgamation of undercover agents in his community he knew about as a teenager.\\n\\nIn the video, he apologized for the story. “The truth is I did have altercations with undercover law enforcement growing up and that experience formed the basis of this story, but it didn’t go down exactly like this,” Minhaj said. “My intention wasn’t to take away from these stories. It was to spotlight them in my special.”\\n\\nFinally, the comedian detailed the oddest of his exaggerated stories, the anthrax scare. In “The King’s Jester,” Minhaj claimed that a letter containing a fine white powder was sent to his home as part of the backlash to his work on Netflix’s “Patriot Act.” In the special as well as in other interviews, Minhaj claimed that the powder, which was believed to be anthrax, fell onto his daughter who was rushed to the hospital.\\n\\nIn both the New Yorker article and in this video, Minhaj admitted this story was embellished. The comedian now says the a letter with white powder was sent to his apartment in February of 2019 after Netflix pulled an episode of “Patriot Act” that was critical of Saudi Arabia. The powder spilled on the kitchen counter, which was near Minhaj’s daughter, but the child never came in contact with the substance and there was never a hospital visit.\\n\\n“I created the hospital scene to put the audience in that same shock and fear that me and Beena [Patel] felt playing out that night,” Minhaj said of his wife. As for why he never told Netflix about the anthrax scare, he said he didn’t do so out of fear Netflix would shut down “Patriot Act.”\\n\\nMinhaj spends the last few minutes of this response directly criticizing the New Yorker over the final lines in the original article, in which Minhaj is quoted as saying, “the emotional truth is first. The factual truth is secondary.” Minhaj said that statement referred to his persona as a storyteller and not as a political comedian and host of series like “The Daily Show” and “Patriot Act.”\\n\\n“With [political comedy] the truth comes first, comedy sometimes comes second to make the infotainment the sugar on the medicine. In [stand-up], the emotional truth is first, the factual truth is secondary,” Minhaj said in his original interview with the New Yorker.\\n\\nThough Minhaj insisted in the video that fact checking was paramount to series like “The Daily Show” and “Patriot Act,” the comedian never addressed the accusations that researchers were kicked out of the “Patriot Act” writers’ room.\\n\\n“Fact-checking at ‘Patriot Act’ was extremely rigorous,” Minhaj told the New Yorker in a written statement in the original article.\\n\\nThe Hollywood Reporter was the first to obtain Minhaj’s video.',\n",

This is because Gaza\\'s hospitals have depleted their resources entirely due to the absence of even the most basic urgent medical supplies, including fuel.\\n\\nSimultaneously, the Ministry of Health in Gaza announced the closure of four hospitals and the bombing of Baptist Hospital, as the number of infections among Gazans has exceeded 11,000.\\n\\nThe Gaza health authorities have reported that hospital bed occupancy in the Gaza Strip has exceeded 150 per cent, forcing hospitals to set up multiple tents to accommodate the wounded and patients, as reported by Al Mamlaka TV.\\n\\nIsraeli violations against medical teams have resulted in the martyrdom of 51 healthcare workers and the injury of 87 others, according to Al Mamlaka.\\n\\n“The total casualties of the Israeli aggression have risen to 4,385 martyrs, including 1,756 children and 967 women, in addition to 13,561 wounded individuals.

Knowing that Israel would not dare attack a hospital during a war, Hamas leaders hide there, launch rockets from its compound, hide hostages in the bowels of the building, torture collaborators, and dig tunnels connecting Shifa to nearby sites.\\n\\nAs far back as 2009, the Israeli Security Agency (Shin Bet) reported during the Gaza war of that year that Hamas operatives were hiding in the hospital, and that the basement had become Hamas’s headquarters.\\n\\nBut it was during the Gaza war of 2014 that Hamas activities in Shifa became too pervasive to miss.\\n\\nForeign media reported that Hamas located its main offices inside Shifa Hospital and some journalists recounted seeing senior Hamas officials in its corridors. Abdel Bari Atwan, a prominent Arab editor said he even saw rocket launches from the hospital compound with his own eyes.\\n\\nAfter the war, one Hamas operative captured by the Shin Bet confirmed that leaders of the terror group hid in the hospital during all the days of fighting.\\n\\nAnd an Amnesty International report on the war released in 2015 accused Hamas of using a disused outpatient clinic to interrogate and torture suspected collaborators. Three Palestinians died in custody, Amnesty reported.\\n\\nIsraeli soldier Gilad Shalit was reportedly kept in a booby-trapped tunnel shaft below the hospital for periods of his five-year captivity, and it is likely that at least some of the 203 hostages taken by Hamas are there too.\\n\\nShifa was originally built by British authorities in 1946. In the 1980s, Israel renovated and expanded the hospital as part of an initiative to improve Gaza living conditions.\\n\\nA source in Gaza told the Tazpit Press Service that during periods of heightened security tensions, portions of Shifa Hospital are routinely sealed off to the public. This restricts access for Gaza residents to various buildings and structures adjacent to the hospital. Additionally, senior Hamas officials are known to receive medical treatment there, especially during military operations.\\n\\nIn recent days, the Israeli Defense Forces have bombed and demolished several buildings close to Shifa Hospital. A Palestinian source in Gaza told the Tazpit Press Service that those buildings are well-known Hamas sites widely believed to be connected to Shifa by underground tunnels.\\n\\nOne of the buildings — just 60 meters from Shifa — was used to produce and repair weapons, including rockets, Israeli security officials said several years ago.\\n\\nPlacing weapons caches, command and control centres, tunnel shafts, rocket launchers and other military infrastructure in close proximity to private homes, schools, hospitals, mosques and civilian areas violates international humanitarian law.\\n\\nIsraeli leaders insist they will eliminate Hamas from Gaza.\\n\\nHow the military deals with the Shifa Hospital remains to be seen.\",\n",

Scroll down to read the report, and turn on audio to hear excerpts of the interviews. Dr. Omar al-Najjar : This war began at its peak. Began at peak destruction. The New Yorker : Have you lost hope in living in Gaza? Dr. Omar al-Najjar : Gaza is the place we were born and raised. However much they try to frighten and scare us, I agree with my family that I can’t ever leave Gaza.\\n\\nNews Desk Another Hospital in Gaza Is Bleeding Doctors in southern Gaza are overwhelmed by the dead and the wounded—and by displaced Palestinians sleeping on the floor.\\n\\nThe baby arrived at Nasser Medical Center, in the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis, just before noon on the tenth day of Israel’s bombing campaign. An air strike had hit the home of a local family, who had been hosting a family of displaced people from Gaza City, to the north. Dozens were injured or killed. Doctors in the emergency room scrambled to assess the newcomers and discovered the still body of an infant boy. He was covered in a thick layer of debris. As a medic began compressions on the baby’s chest, Mohammed Zaqout, a senior pediatrician and the former director of the hospital, came over to examine the infant—and detected a breath. “Praise God, the baby didn’t have any injuries!,” Ayman al-Farra, a Gaza health official who has worked in the hospital’s emergency room since the start of the conflict, told us, in a telephone interview. But who were the boy’s parents, and what was his name? The baby was hardly the first unidentified patient the doctors had treated since Israel began bombing Gaza. Omar al-Najjar, a twenty-four-year-old intern stationed in the emergency room, explained in a phone interview that when an air strike hits a home, it often injures or kills everyone in a family, leaving no one available to identify the dead and wounded. “So we write ‘Unknown 1,’ ‘Unknown 2,’ ‘Unknown 3,’ ” he said. An unidentified but otherwise healthy baby was an unusual circumstance—but Najjar scarcely had time to notice. “We don’t feel the beginning or the end of the day, because we are continuously in the E.R.,” he told us.

Photograph by Yousef Masoud / NYT / Redux Najjar lives east of Khan Younis, in a town that is half a mile from the fortified barrier that marks the border with Israel. (His grandparents had lived in a village near the coastal city of Jaffa, in what is now Israel, and had fled to Gaza as refugees.) On the morning of October 7th, Najjar had been asleep at home when Hamas fighters broke through the barrier and slaughtered fourteen hundred Israelis in surrounding towns. The next day, the Israel Defense Forces instructed the residents of Najjar’s town, via text, to evacuate immediately. Najjar’s family fled to Khan Younis: his parents squeezed into the home of a relative, in the center of town, while his pregnant sister and her family moved into a United Nations school for refugees. Najjar himself began living full-time at the hospital where he worked, sleeping on the floor of the office of internal medicine. Administrators placed the hospital’s staff—about a thousand people—on alternating twenty-four-hour shifts; Najjar usually helps out during his days off, too. In any case, he noted, “I don’t have a place to return to.” On the eighth day of air strikes, he learned that Israeli bombs had destroyed his home and flattened the area around it.

Right: a map of Israel and Palestine, showing Palestinian territories in green.\\n\\nFarra, the health official working in the emergency room, told us that hundreds of other doctors and nurses are also living at the hospital, sleeping on mattress pads in overcrowded hallways and offices. “There’s not a nurses’ room or doctor’s office that doesn’t have twenty staff members in it,” he said. As hundreds of thousands of Gazans have fled the bombs and an expected ground invasion from Israel, thousands of healthy people have also moved into the hospital complex. To the doctors’ frustration, the displaced have bedded down in courtyards, in corridors, and even atop roofs. “They put their bags down, and that becomes their place,” Najjar told us. “There’s not one place that’s empty.” Clogged hallways and elevators are slowing down medical staff and inhibiting the transport of patients, and the swelling population is straining the hospital’s limited supply of well water. But what can the hospital do? Waleed Abu Hatab, the director of maternal medicine, told us, “We can’t stop them from using the bathrooms or water—there’s no way we can do that.” So far, the hospital has remained an island of safety. Repeated air strikes have destroyed much of the surrounding neighborhood. In photographs, the pale red-brick tower of the Nasser Medical Center now stands like a lighthouse overlooking a sea of rubble. (A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces told us that they do not target hospitals.) But, as the siege continues, conditions inside are deteriorating. During a phone call with us, Farra called out to a colleague, “Ibrahim, did bread come today?” The answer was no. Farra and other doctors told us that since the war began the hospital has been feeding its patients and staff only rice for lunch and dinner, sometimes adding cheese and cucumbers at the evening meal. “The Health Ministry can’t bring fruit now, because it’s in very short supply,” Farra said. “I was at a vegetable market earlier, and the prices are very high. We can’t provide them.” Omar al-Najjar, a twenty-four-year-old medical intern, has been living at the Nasser Medical Center since the bombardment started. Many people have taken refuge at the hospital and are also sheltering there full time. Omar al-Najjar, a twenty-four-year-old medical intern, has been living at the Nasser Medical Center since the bombardment started. Many people have taken refuge at the hospital and are also sheltering there full time. The hospital, which is designed to accommodate three hundred and fifty inpatients, is dangerously overfull: administrators have tripled the number of beds in the emergency room to sixty, doubled the number of operating rooms to twelve, and expanded the intensive-care unit from twelve beds to forty. Yet, even in the intensive-care unit, some of the wounded must be laid on the ground or in the hall, because there are not enough beds. Najjar, the intern, told us that the victims of bombings always arrive in large numbers—at least ten at a time. Farra told us, “All the injuries are serious—they require surgeries and intensive care.” He continued, “The medicine has been depleted. The anesthesia has been depleted.” There are shortages of chest tubes, dialysis filters, saline solution, and orthopedic equipment. Najjar told us that he was forced to tell a patient with a face wound to go out to a local drug store to buy the supplies needed to stitch up the gash. The hospital’s biggest crisis, however, is its dwindling supply of fuel and electricity. Farra said that the hospital typically burns thirteen hundred gallons of fuel a day to produce its own electricity during the frequent blackouts that afflict Gaza. Now the Israeli siege has entirely cut off the power; when we spoke, Farra said that there was only enough fuel left for two or three more days. To conserve power for surgeries and intensive care, the hospital had already shut off the electricity in many of its units, such as pediatrics and internal medicine. “The mortuary refrigerators, of course, have stopped operating, so we can’t hold on to the deceased—and their numbers are big,” Farra added. “We are fearful that we will have to make mass graves.” Najjar told us that another Gazan hospital was storing the dead in ice-cream trucks. The New Yorker : Are you going to take austerity measures? Dr. Ayman al-Farra : The maximum austerity measures have been taken. Electricity has been turned off in many units. The mortuary refrigerators, of course, have stopped operating. So we can’t hold on to the deceased. We are fearful that we’ll have to make mass graves. The lack of electricity is also threatening to close the dialysis unit, even though it now serves an influx of new patients from the north of Gaza. “Thousands of people will die,” Farra said. Without electricity, the pumps that draw water from the hospital’s wells would also stop working. “We’re reaching the point in which we have to shut down,” Farra said. “The patients are going to die in front of us, and we’re not going to be able to do anything.” Early on October 20th, the Gaza Health Ministry sent out an “urgent distress call to all gas station owners and anyone who has any liter of diesel,” asking for donations “to save the lives of the wounded and sick.”\\n\\nFarra told us that, at the direction of Gaza’s Health Ministry, hospital administrators have begun preserving resources by denying care that the hospital would normally provide to patients whose chances of recovery are considered slim. “We make a decision not to put them on a ventilator, and we give the opportunity to someone who has hopes of living.” The bodies of people killed by Israeli air strikes lie in a makeshift morgue outside the Nasser Medical Center.

Photograph by Samar Abu Elouf / NYT / Redux On October 17th, Farra said, the hospital had reluctantly removed three struggling patients from the intensive-care unit. One was a ten-year-old boy whose brain had been penetrated by shrapnel. “From his pupils, we were able to surmise that he was likely brain-dead,” he told us. “We need beds for other patients.” (The boy died that night, Farra later confirmed.) Other doctors did not want to discuss such painful trade-offs. Abu Hatab, the head of maternal medicine, insisted that the hospital was denying care only rarely. “If this happened with one or two cases, it would have been only after several doctors said that the case is totally hopeless,” he told us, adding, “Unfortunately, we’ll have to do things that are very far away from ideal practices in medicine.” But Farra and Najjar said that even the E.R. is becoming increasingly selective about which incoming patients are given intensive care. Farra said that “the hopeless cases are given a place where they are followed closely, but they don’t get the intervention that they normally would. Working with them will make us lose time that could be spent saving others.” Najjar said that admitting a patient can take up to two hours because doctors must be persuaded to free up a bed by discharging another patient. On October 12th, a young boy had arrived at the hospital with a head wound that required surgery, but all the operating rooms were full—and there was no free ventilator, which was needed to keep him alive. Najjar recalled, “We were told there are no beds left in the intensive-care unit, but we told the I.C.U., ‘No, he has to go in, that won’t work.’ ” After four hours of tense negotiations, the I.C.U. made a ventilator available for the boy by unplugging an older patient and transferring him to an oxygen tank. The boy’s life was saved, Naggar told us; the older patient’s fate was unclear.\\n\\nDoctors, too, are dying in Gaza. Najjar told us that he knew of several who had been killed by air strikes: the dean of his medical school, a friend who worked at a Gaza City hospital, a burn surgeon on a brief visit home, a family doctor, alongside her husband and her children. Another victim, an eminent pathologist, was a personal mentor of Najjar’s. When he heard the news, he said, “I couldn’t hold myself together—I walked over to a corner and started crying.” Every couple of days, Najjar briefly leaves the hospital to check on his family, and he worries that a bomb might end his life on the way. “You also see piles of trash around you, people sleeping on the ground outside, destroyed homes,” he noted. “All of this makes you anxious.” On the fifth day of the war, Najjar heard the sound of a strike not far from the hospital. The first patient to reach the E.R. was one of his relatives. He was badly bruised and burned in many places, and one of his hands had been wounded. The relative was conscious enough to convey that Najjar’s parents—who were staying in a house next to the site of the blast—had survived. But the bombing killed five of their relatives, one of whom was disfigured beyond recognition. Najjar told us that a cousin had come to the hospital to identify the bodies. Injured children being treated at the Nasser Medical Center. Injured children being treated at the Nasser Medical Center. Photograph by Mohammed Talatene / dpa / AP “You try to hold it together,” Najjar told us. But then, on October 17th, he heard the news that an explosion had destroyed the Arab Ahli hospital in Gaza City—killing hundreds, according to initial reports. (The Israeli military and U.S. intelligence agencies say that a malfunctioning missile fired by Palestinian militants struck the Gaza City hospital; Hamas has blamed an Israeli air strike.) At the same moment, several injured members of a prominent family in Khan Younis were arriving at Nasser Medical Center. Najjar told us, “I wasn’t able to endure it. I was supposed to help the wounded, but I went to a corner and fell to the ground.” It took him ten minutes to regain his composure and resume treating patients. When Najjar was asked how he felt about Hamas—which controls Gaza—and the attack that triggered Israel’s retaliation, he said that he could not answer. Associates of his told us that Najjar, like many young Palestinians, had long ago soured on the leadership of all the competing Palestinian political factions. To us, he said only that the ordeal of the war had destroyed what was left of the hope he had placed in “the international community.” Najjar said, “No one can get humanitarian aid in, how are they going to stop the war? How are they going to do justice for us and give us a state?” The world powers, he said, were “biased for and afraid of Israel—so where will the solution come from?” Farra, the health official, was less guarded. He said that, about twenty years ago, he had worked for seven months on a cardiac ward at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. (Gadi Keren, an Israeli cardiologist there, warmly recalled working with Nasser staff. “There are many great people in Gaza,” he told us. He then said of Hamas, “Unfortunately, this terror group is destroying the lives of more than two million.”) Farra told us that his experience of the world outside Gaza had reinforced his conviction that both Hamas and the Israeli military were wrong to target civilians. Hamas’s assault on October 7th, he said, was “absolutely unacceptable.” A woman cradles the body of a child who was killed in an Israeli strike.

Photograph by Mohammed Salem / Reuters Farra praised the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who in the nineteen-nineties launched the Oslo Accords, which laid out a path to a two-state solution. “We want to live in peace, side by side, but killing entire families like this—there won’t be any chance for peace and coexistence left,” he said. “Extremism and narrow-mindedness caused this catastrophe, and it will be reflected across the entire region. Every action has a reaction. Everyone who lost a family member wants to take revenge. On both sides, it leads to violence and extremism.” Given Hamas’s tight control of Gaza, very few residents have so openly criticized the assault. But Farra insisted that, despite the deaths caused by Israel’s air strikes, there were many other Gazans who still shared his peaceable views. “We are people who love life. Who love peace. These are deadly wars that are bringing destruction for everyone.”',\n",

       " {'articleBody': 'Giannis Antetokounmpo has indicated on social media that he has agreed to a contract extension with the Milwaukee Bucks.\\n\\nAntetokounmpo issued a social media post on Monday that said, “MILWAUKEEEEEEEEE!! Let’s get it!!!! #BucksInSix #Extended.” The post came as ESPN reported that the two-time MVP had agreed on a three-year extension worth $186 million, with a player option for the 2027-28 season.\\n\\nThe Bucks didn’t make an official announcement, but they reposted Antetokounmpo’s post on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. The Bucks’ repost, which was later deleted, included the message, “The best possible cure for the Mondays.”\\n\\nAntetokounmpo’s announcement came as Minnesota’s Jaden McDaniels, Washington’s Deni Avdija and Orlando’s Cole Anthony led the first wave of fourth-year players to reach agreements on contract extensions ahead of the NBA’s deadline.\\n\\nAntetokounmpo had said this summer that he didn’t plan to sign an extension this year because it would make more financial sense for him to wait until the summer. The two-time MVP also had indicated that he wanted to wait to see how committed the Bucks were toward winning another title before he decided on whether to sign an extension on his contract, which at the time ran through 2024-25 with a player option for 2025-26.\\n\\nSince then, the Bucks made a blockbuster trade to acquire seven-time all-NBA guard Damian Lillard from the Portland Trail Blazers. Even after that trade, Antetokounmpo had indicated he didn’t expect to sign an extension this year.\\n\\n“I said that it did not make sense to sign the contract right now because money’s not important — a lot of money is important. So I’m going to sign it next year,” Antetokounmpo said with a laugh during the Bucks’ Media Day event on Oct. 2. “But, no, at the end of the day, again, it doesn’t make sense. It does not make sense for me to sign it right now. I’ve got to always look at what’s best for me and my family, for my situation.\\n\\n“But at the end of the day, I want to be a Milwaukee Buck for the rest of my career, as long as we are winning. It’s as simple as that.”\\n\\nThe extension starts with the 2025-26 season, meaning Antetokounmpo is under contract for at least four more years — and a fifth if he’s so inclined. He will earn about $94.4 million over the next two seasons, then about $120 million more for the 2025-26 and 2026-27 seasons.\\n\\nThe last year is at his option, meaning he could make roughly $66 million more in 2027-28.\\n\\nAnd if Antetokounmpo had waited until next summer to agree to an extension, he possibly may have secured earned even more money. A max-extension scenario had he waited until 2024 could have been a four-year agreement at a figure exceeding $250 million.\\n\\nAs far as the extensions involving fourth-year players, agent Bill Duffy confirmed that McDaniels and the Timberwolves agreed on a five-year, $136 million extension. The 28th overall pick in 2020, who came to Minnesota in the same draft as star Anthony Edwards, had a breakout third season with an average of 12.1 points per game on 51.7% shooting.\\n\\nWith three maximum contract players on the roster in Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert, the Timberwolves have committed themselves to the luxury tax range with their salary cap. But the 6-foot-9 McDaniels is the team’s best defender and one of the league’s best shutdown wings, and the Timberwolves believe he has untapped offensive potential to pair with his defensive ability.\\n\\n“I feel like, shoot, I can go out and score 25 points every night if I wanted to,” McDaniels said at the beginning of training camp.\\n\\nThe Timberwolves open their season at Toronto on Wednesday. McDaniels currently has a calf injury, putting his status for the game in doubt.\\n\\nAvdija agreed to a four-year, $55 million extension with the Wizards, a person with knowledge of the deal told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team hadn’t announced the agreement. The 22-year-old Avdija started a career-high 40 games last season and averaged 9.2 points and 6.4 rebounds. Washington drafted him in the first round in 2020.\\n\\nAvdija is somewhat remarkably the longest-tenured player on the Wizards. They traded Bradley Beal to Phoenix in the offseason and enter 2023-24 with a significantly different roster. Avdija, a 6-foot-9 forward from Israel, has averaged 8.1 points in 212 career games since the Wizards made him the ninth overall pick in the 2020 draft.\\n\\nAnthony and the Magic agreed to a three-year, $39 million extension, which the team announced Monday. The son of 11-year NBA veteran Greg Anthony, he was the 15th overall pick in the 2020 draft.\\n\\nThe point guard missed more than a month last season with an oblique muscle injury and saw his scoring average drop by more than three points per game. After starting all 65 games he played in during the 2021-22 season with Markelle Fultz sidelined by injury, Anthony returned to a role off the bench once Fultz was back in the starting lineup.\\n\\nBut Anthony shot a career-best 45.4% from the field, including 36.4% from 3-point range, and reduced his turnovers by an average of more than one per game.\\n\\nElsewhere, the San Antonio Spurs announced a multiyear extension for center Zach Collins. The 10th overall pick in the 2017 draft averaged a career-high 11.6 points per game last season.\\n\\nAlso, the Atlanta Hawks signed forward-center Onyeka Okongwu to a four-year, $62 million rookie contract extension.\\n\\nOkongwu has started in 28 of 178 career games, averaging 7.9 points and 5.7 rebounds. He could play a larger role this season, following the trade of power forward John Collins to Utah.\\n\\nThe deal with Okongwu came after the team exercised the fourth-year contract option on forward Jalen Johnson and the third-year option on guard AJ Griffin.\\n\\nThe Dallas Mavericks and Josh Green agreed on a $41 million, three-year contract extension coming off the most productive of the guard’s three seasons.\\n\\nNews of the deal comes two days before the Mavericks open the regular season in San Antonio, with Green set to see how he fits with a retooled roster around stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.\\n\\nA first-round draft pick in 2020, Green has provided energy and athleticism off the bench, with more of an impact in 2022-23 than the Australian’s first two seasons.\\n\\nGreen, who turns 23 next month, missed 20 games with a right elbow sprain last season but still started a career-high 21 games while averaging 9.1 points and 3.0 rebounds.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds and AP Sports Writers Dave Campbell, Steve Megargee and Charles Odum contributed to this report.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports',\n",

       " {'articleBody': \"Benchmark stock market indices witnessed a significant decline on Thursday, with both benchmark indices experiencing a prolonged losing streak.\\n\\nThe S&P BSE Sensex plummeted by 811.19 points to 63,237.87, while the NSE Nifty 50 dropped below 18,900, shedding over 246 points. This marks the longest losing streak for the benchmark indices in eight months.\\n\\nThe broader domestic market indices, including Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100, were not immune to the downturn, both registering declines of over 2 per cent. Adding to the unease, India VIX, a measure of market volatility, surged by 10 percent, indicating a tense atmosphere on Dalal Street.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nBloodbath on Dalal Street\\n\\nVarious sectoral indices experienced substantial losses, with prominent sectors like Nifty Bank, Nifty Financial Services, and Nifty IT falling between 1.3 per cent and 1.7 per cent. Nifty Media and Nifty Realty were among the hardest hit, with both sectoral indices declining over 2.4 per cent.\\n\\nWhile the majority of blue-chip stocks faced a downturn, Axis Bank and HCLTech were notable gainers on the benchmark indices.\\n\\nAnalysts had anticipated this market correction due to the consistent decline observed in recent trading sessions.\\n\\nFactors behind weakness\\n\\nThe substantial downturn today is attributed to a combination of factors, including global market weakness, concerns about rising US Treasury yields, escalating geopolitical tensions, and the monthly F&O expiry.\\n\\nIT stocks bore the brunt of the market's concern, primarily due to fears of a potential increase in interest rates, driven by the rise in US Treasury yields. Additionally, disappointing Q2 results from major IT firms contributed to the subdued market sentiment.\\n\\nTech Mahindra, in particular, experienced a decline of more than 3 per cent in early trade, as it reported its most significant drop in net profit in over 16 years. Many brokerages have expressed concerns about the company's future growth prospects.\\n\\nAnother contributing factor was the decline in Adani Group stocks, with all 10 listed companies within the conglomerate falling. This followed a report suggesting that the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), India's accounting regulator, was scrutinising one of the group's auditors.\\n\\nThe Nifty Financial Services index saw a sharp downturn, largely due to the decline of financial heavyweights Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv, which both fell by nearly 3 per cent.\\n\\nGlobal stocks, led by the US, also witnessed a decline, which had a cascading effect on Indian market sentiments.\\n\\nWith the 10-year bond yield in the US approaching 5 percent, foreign investors are likely to engage in selling activities.\\n\\nAdditionally, the ongoing Israel-Hamas war raised concerns about potential global growth derailment and its impact on high oil-importing nations like India.\",\n",

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Dire scenarios await Gaza’s medical professionals. They face dwindling basic resources such as power, water and anesthesia, compelling doctors to confront wrenching decisions on whose lives to save. The growing humanitarian crisis is plunging health-care workers into the critical emergency planning that follows both human-made and natural disasters — assessing staffing and other resources, managing existing health needs on top of gruesome new ones, and looking out for their own welfare.\\n\\n“When we are in a disaster setting or conflict, we usually have more patients than resources. We have to be very creative to be able to provide the best care for the most number of people,” said Lindsey Ryan Martin, who is director of global disaster response and humanitarian action at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and has been monitoring the situation in Gaza.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe health-care crisis extends beyond Tuesday’s deadly blast at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City. Aid organizations say the war continues to imperil an already beleaguered health-care system.\\n\\nGaza’s Health Ministry said five hospitals were out of service as of Thursday and an additional 14 health facilities have closed because they lack fuel and electricity.\\n\\nAfter Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack into Israel on Oct. 7, Israel imposed a “full siege” on the Gaza Strip, cutting off electricity, food and fuel and limiting access to medical supplies and cross-border travel for high-risk diagnoses or operations.\\n\\nAssessing and verifying the realities of medical care on the ground in Gaza has been difficult because of challenges communicating with medical professionals and limited access for reporters.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nU.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths told The Washington Post on Wednesday that the hospital blast worsened the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, putting out of commission a hospital that treated 45,000 patients per year.\\n\\n“Health workers, why would they stay?” Griffiths said. “And how can you move the sick people that we’ve already been discussing for the last few days, coming out of the hospital in Gaza City — how can you move them when they’re in ICUs?”\\n\\nAfter the blast at al-Ahli, Palestinian health officials said the flood of patients to nearby al-Shifa, the main hospital in Gaza City, exceeded the capabilities of medical teams and ambulances. They said doctors resorted to treating wounded patients on the hospital floor, some without anesthesia.\\n\\nAn anesthesia specialist at al-Shifa told The Post that bodies have been left in the hallway after attempts to save people failed. He shared a video that he had taken showing a chaotic scene: patients being treated on a teal floor, a man imploring others to take out a dead body to bring in another patient.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe hospital worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment to reporters, worries about infections rising because of the lack of clean water and electricity to desalinate the water supply. He’s already seeing infections, diarrhea and fevers on the rise and fears more dehydration in children.\\n\\nThe hospital worker said he last slept properly on Oct. 5, before the conflict began, and doesn’t know whether his home is still standing. “It’s also the last time I saw my wife and my kids,” he said.\\n\\nErica L. Nelson, who has worked in humanitarian medicine for about 25 years, said Palestinian doctors at al-Shifa who are in her WhatsApp group are becoming more fearful of being targeted. “The additional component of ‘We are at risk’ has changed the tenor of the conversation,” said Nelson, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nInternational aid organizations in recent days added to the portrait of a tattered health-care system in Gaza.\\n\\nShare this article Share\\n\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said medicine for hundreds of thousands of patients is in short supply. Airstrikes have made operating ambulances and transferring patients to health facilities “extremely dangerous,” according to Doctors Without Borders, which has staff on the ground in Gaza. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said Wednesday that fewer than half of its health centers could offer basic care to patients. All three organizations confirmed reports that lives are in jeopardy as generators run out of fuel.\\n\\nThe WHO has called on Israel to allow shipments of fuel as part of a deal brokered to permit humanitarian aid to Gaza.\\n\\n“When fuel runs out, that may mean operating with flashlights or taking care of people with medications that don’t require refrigeration and certainly not having lab services,” said John Broach, director of the division of emergency medical services and disaster management at UMass Memorial in Worcester, Mass.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBroach said the struggle to care for patients injured in a war or disaster is exacerbated by the escalation of routine medical issues suddenly left untreated, such as people with well-managed diabetes now unable to take insulin spoiled when refrigerators lose power and chronically ill patients unable to fill prescriptions at shuttered pharmacies.\\n\\nDavid Callaway, chief medical officer for veteran-led Team Rubicon, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit group that works closely with the WHO to provide relief in humanitarian crises, said there are dangerous consequences to health-care workers toiling nonstop with limited resources during disasters.\\n\\n“Soon all the team is burned out, their empathy is gone and they are not making best decisions,” said Callaway, who served as a battalion surgeon during the Iraq War and more recently oversaw humanitarian aid his organization provided in Ukraine.\\n\\nThe decisions health-care workers face in disasters are momentous: As they focus on the patient in front of them, they are acutely aware of massive needs elsewhere. “You feel like you have to put different values on different lives based on what you see in the moment,” Callaway said. “Is a kid’s life more valuable than an elderly person’s?”\\n\\nThomas Kirsch, an emergency-medicine physician at George Washington University Hospital and an early practitioner of disaster medicine, recalled the moral dilemmas that came up when he was working with a Johns Hopkins team in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nResources simply were not available to treat everyone in need, he said. “You can be forced into a situation where you can’t do what’s best for your patient, either causing a patient harm or allowing them to die,” Kirsch said.\\n\\nThose decisions, he said, are best taken out of the hands of the person providing care, by creating an ethics counselor or committee.\\n\\nAt the same time, disasters force providers to come up with systematic ways to tailor the care they are able to provide. “Can you scrub without soap? Re-use sterile drapes? Boil water on a stove?” Kirsch said.\\n\\nSome superficial surgical procedures can be performed without anesthesia, Kirsch said, evoking images of Civil War-era operations. “But you can’t operate on the heart, the lungs, the abdomen,” he said.\\n\\nPaul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says doctors in conflict zones operate in ways they were never trained to do. As a young general practitioner caring for severely mutilated patients during the Rwandan genocide, Spiegel said he followed instructions the best he could, amputating fingers and addressing other grisly wounds despite having no specialized training in those procedures. “You have no choice,” he said. “You tell yourself you’ll probably do it better than a layperson.”\\n\\nThe health-care system in the Gaza Strip, which has been under Israeli blockade for 16 years, already struggled before the war. The Israeli Civil Administration controls the entry and exit of all patients and goods, which can restrict care. Recent attacks that damaged medical infrastructure are reminiscent of conflict in 2014, when 24 medical facilities were damaged and more than 15 health workers were killed in a 50-day Israeli offensive in Gaza.\\n\\nExperts say war leaves lasting scars on health-care systems as officials face the daunting task of rebuilding facilities — and rebuilding trust in patients afraid to seek care after places of healing turned into danger zones.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“For months, years afterward, this community is still going to have a disrupted health-care system,” said Rohini Haar, a medical adviser at Physicians for Human Rights who has researched the aftermath of war on health-care systems. “The folks in a community that are attacked are going to be experiencing this attack for years after.”\\n\\nDadouch reported from Beirut.

       " {'articleBody': 'Even before this week’s deadly hospital blast, Gaza’s health system was already on the brink of collapse. At least 3,700 Palestinians in Gaza have been declared dead since the beginning of the Israeli-Hamas war, and an estimated 12,000 have been injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Gaza’s health system has faced a huge influx of emergency patients, while at the same time suffering the effects of bombardment and having utilities cut.\\n\\nOn October 13, the Israeli military told everyone in the north of Gaza to evacuate. This created an impossible situation for hospitals filled with patients who were too unwell to be moved. The World Health Organization said the evacuation order was a “death sentence” for the sick and injured.\\n\\n“The whole health system is collapsing around us,” says Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a plastic surgeon with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) who is working in Gaza at Al-Shifa Hospital, the biggest medical facility in the Gaza Strip, located in Gaza City. He paints a picture of a system stripped down to the bare bones.\\n\\nThe orthopedic department has run out of the pins and rods needed to stabilize fractures, Abu-Sittah says. The water pressure has become too weak to run the sterilization machines that disinfect equipment, meaning the hospital staff are forced to rely on a chemical antiseptic that hasn’t been commonly used for decades. There are no ventilators available. There is not even enough room for the injured in the hospital. “There is no more space or mattresses to put the wounded on in the corridors,” says Abu-Sittah. Health care staff are exhausted and are struggling to deal with the overwhelming number of injured.\\n\\nOn October 18, Abu-Sittah helped treat a patient with a wound that had become infected and septic. But with all operating rooms full, doctors could not treat it in time, and the patient will lose a leg as a result.\\n\\nSince Israel blocked access to electricity in Gaza more than a week ago, hospitals have been relying on backup generators. Now they’re running dangerously low on fuel. The United Nations Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported on Wednesday that Gaza’s Ministry of Health is redistributing fuel from other public facilities to keep hospital generators running. “They’re running out of everything,” says Zaher Sahloul, the president of MedGlobal, an NGO that is supporting medical facilities in Gaza. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has said that without electricity, “hospitals risk turning into morgues.”',\n",
